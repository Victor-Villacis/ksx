//! The one adapter from typed verbs to a [`ControlSource`], over **either**
//! transport.
//!
//! This is the module the M9 decision is about (docs/M9-DECISION.md §6). A
//! surface is written once against [`ControlSource`]; a [`VerbSink`] decides
//! how the verb reaches the daemon:
//!
//! | sink | how | consumer |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`crate::PipeTransport`] | one `\\.\pipe\ksx-daemon` JSON line per call | Studio, `ksx session`, the E5 MCP shim, a shell in a SEPARATE process |
//! | a hosted supervisor | the daemon's own dispatch, called directly — no line, no parse | a UI hosted INSIDE the daemon process |
//!
//! The second row is E7's "no serialization tax, mapping 1:1 to
//! `DaemonCommand`", delivered as an implementation of a shared trait rather
//! than as a second copy of every verb. Nothing above this line knows which
//! row it is on, which is exactly why building the native shell later costs
//! the shell and not the verbs.
