//! The WRITE side: the session and mapper verbs, with **exactly the tray's
//! reach and no more** (docs/CONTROL-SURFACE.md invariant 1).
//!
//! Every method here is one `DaemonCommand` enqueued on the daemon's control
//! loop, or one call into the single mapping writer — and nothing else. There
//! is no path from this trait to the capture thread, the engine thread or the
//! output thread, and an implementation is a CLIENT of the daemon's control
//! channel, never a second control loop. That is what makes the same trait
//! safe to satisfy over a pipe (Studio, `ksx session`, the E5 MCP shim) and
//! in-process (a shell that hosts the supervisor): the reach is identical
//! either way, so the choice of transport cannot widen it.
//!
//! Two shapes of answer, and the split is deliberate:
//!
//! - `Result<String, Refusal>` — a verb whose failure is a sentence.
//! - `BindOutcome` / `MacroOutcome` / `LearnView` — a verb whose failure
//!   carries STRUCTURE a sentence cannot hold (the conflicting slot, the
//!   validator's problems one per row, the learner's countdown). Each one
//!   still hands out a [`Refusal`] on request, so the "say so, per click"
//!   invariant reads the same everywhere.
