//! **The live fan-out: what a surface sees of a running pipeline.**
//!
//! This module is the *shape* of the stream. The sink that fills it lives in
//! `ksx-backend` (`crate::feed`), because it owns the pipeline; the shape lives
//! here so that every consumer names one set of types — the cabinet's button
//! check and Studio's `/check` today, E8's feedback bus next
//! (docs/ENHANCEMENTS.md E8: "the feedback consumer is a BUS, not a lamp
//! driver"; docs/MAPPER-UX.md Build C: "same socket feeds the E8 light bus and
//! the 3D viewer later — one stream, three consumers").
//!
//! # The three rules this stream is built on
//!
//! 1. **Lossy, always.** A consumer that cannot keep up loses frames and is
//!    told how many. It can never backpressure the engine — the same rule as
//!    the M4 delta coalescing and E7's "a slow browser can never backpressure
//!    the engine".
//! 2. **Display-rate coalesced (~60 Hz), and coalesced by the CONSUMER.** The
//!    producer publishes transitions; [`LiveFrame`] is what a consumer folds
//!    them into when it wakes to paint. That ordering matters: a producer that
//!    sampled at 60 Hz would *miss* a 8 ms button tap, and the one thing a
//!    button check may never do is fail to notice a press.
//! 3. **Never a callback into a pipeline thread.** There is no closure
//!    anywhere in this stream. The pipeline pushes into a bounded queue and
//!    walks away; every consumer runs on its own thread and pulls. A wedged
//!    UI costs a window, never a keyboard (docs/CONTROL-SURFACE.md
//!    "Invariants a GUI must not break").
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! The two-column truth of the button check: **what the panel sent** beside
//! **what the pad published**, per slot. Those are different facts and the gap
//! between them is the whole diagnosis — a key that arrives but lights no
//! control is an unbound key; a control that lights with no key behind it is a
//! macro or a chord; neither column moving is a wiring fault upstream of ksx.

/// subscription, with its own queue and its own drop counter.
///
/// # Why the feed is its own channel and not a verb on the control pipe
///
/// The control pipe (`ksx_api::pipe`) is **one JSON line out, one JSON line
/// in, per connection**, and every one of its properties is wrong for a
/// stream:
///
/// 1. **The daemon serves it SEQUENTIALLY.** One thread, one connection at a
///    time, the next instance created before the current one is served. A
///    connection that stayed open to carry frames would hold that thread for
///    as long as the tab was open, and `status` / `start` / `stop` would never
///    be answered again — one browser tab would take the daemon's whole
///    control surface down with it.
/// 2. **The client budget is one answer.** `RESPONSE_BUDGET` is ten seconds
///    for the *slowest honest verb*; a stream has no single answer to wait
///    for, so the budget would either fire on a quiet panel or have to be
///    removed — and removing it is the exact change that froze a cabinet
///    window (`ksx_api::pipe::RESPONSE_BUDGET`).
/// 3. **A poll verb has nowhere to keep the subscription.** The queue and the
///    per-consumer dropped counter are what make loss *visible*; both live in
///    the subscription, and a connection-per-request transport destroys it
///    between calls. Everything that happened between two polls would be lost
///    with no count — the silent failure the whole fan-out is built to avoid.
///
/// So: a second pipe ([`LIVE_PIPE_NAME`]), one direction, thread per
/// connection, subscription alive for the connection's life. The control pipe
/// keeps its shape and its single-threaded simplicity, and the two channels
/// fail independently — a wedged stream cannot stop you pressing Stop.

/// blocked was painting a window. Here, waiting IS the operation — a quiet
/// panel is supposed to produce nothing — and the contract is different in the

///
/// - the caller must run this on a thread that owns nothing but the stream
