//! The live feed's transport: `\\.\pipe\ksx-live`, one direction, many frames
//! per connection.
//!
//! [`crate::live`] is the *shape*; this is the line it travels on for a surface
//! that is not inside the daemon's process. It is the exact counterpart of
//! [`crate::pipe`] — same `std`-only file I/O, same "a non-Windows open simply
//! fails NotFound, which is the truthful *no daemon here* answer", same
//! `NotRunning` verdict — and the differences are all consequences of one fact:
//! **a stream is not a conversation.**
//!
//! | | control pipe | live pipe |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | shape | one line out, one line in, per connection | many lines in, none out, per connection |
//! | direction | duplex | `PIPE_ACCESS_OUTBOUND` — the client *cannot* write |
//! | daemon side | one thread, connections served in turn | one thread per connection |
//! | deadline | [`crate::pipe::TransportError::TimedOut`] after a budget | none; waiting is the operation |
//! | lifetime | the length of one verb | the length of one open tab |
//!
//! [`crate::LiveSource`]'s docs carry the three reasons this could not be a
//! verb on the control pipe. The short version is the last row: a subscription
//! that dies between calls loses every event between them, and loses the count
//! as well.
