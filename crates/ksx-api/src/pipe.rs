//! The pipe transport: one JSON line out, one JSON line in, per connection.
//!
//! Plain `std` file I/O. `\\.\pipe\...` opens through `CreateFileW` under std,
//! so the client needs no FFI and compiles everywhere (a non-Windows open
//! simply fails NotFound, which is the truthful "no daemon here" answer).
//!
//! This is one implementation of [`crate::VerbSink`], and the *only* thing it
//! adds over the in-process one is the line: same request type, same response
//! type, same parser. That is what makes the choice of transport a deployment
//! decision rather than an architectural one — and why the "serialization tax"
//! argument for a native UI is a measurement, not a premise (docs/M9-DECISION.md).
