//! One refusal type, replacing the bare `String` errors the surfaces used to
//! pass around (docs/M9-DECISION.md §6).
//!
//! The point is not tidiness. CONTROL-SURFACE's invariant — **"a surface that
//! cannot act must SAY so, per click"** — was a review checklist item as long
//! as a refusal was a `String`: nothing in the type system asked whether the
//! sentence named the way out. [`Refusal::remedy`] makes it a field, so a
//! surface that wants to print "…and here is the command that works anyway"
//! has somewhere to read it from, and a caller that forgets is visibly
//! forgetting something.
