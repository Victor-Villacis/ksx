//! The staged setup, on the wire — `docs/FIRST-RUN.md` §2.
//!
//! [`ksx_core::StagedSetup`] is the domain value: a setup a user is still
//! deciding on, held in the daemon for the length of a visit, with no path to a
//! file. This module is how a surface drives it and how a surface renders it.
//!
//! # The shape is [`crate::control::MacroWrite`]'s, deliberately
//!
//! A [`StageEdit`] is what arrives from a form or a JSON body: strings a human
//! or a browser produced, which may be blank and may be wrong.
//! [`StageEdit::apply`] is the ONE place a wire word becomes a core operation,
//! and a bad word is refused THERE — in ksx-core's own sentence, with no round
//! trip and nothing changed. That is the same split `MacroWrite::to_request`
//! makes, and for the same reason: the daemon's parser stays strict, so a
//! genuine typo is still refused in words that name the options.
//!
//! # Every number here is SERVED, never known by the surface
//!
//! [`StagedSetupView`] carries `max_slots`, `max_xinput_slots`, `xinput_used`
//! and the whole persona roster with build capability, immutable output route,
//! persona ceiling and current-stage availability on each. `docs/CLAUDE.md`
//! and `SURFACES.md` §1 make that a rule rather than a courtesy: a `16` typed
//! into TypeScript is the specific bug the rule exists for, and the day
//! the production HIDMaestro host lands and the roster changes underneath
//! every surface at once, with nothing to edit.
//!
//! # Looking is never a commitment
//!
//! Nothing on this module writes, claims or plugs. [`StageOutcome`] reports what
//! a *save* did only when [`crate::ControlSource::stage_commit`] was called, and
//! [`crate::ControlSource::stage_play`] starts a session from a plan built with
//! no file write at all — `FIRST-RUN.md` §2's "saving and playing are separate
//! acts", stated as two verbs.

///
/// 1. It is the wrong chart for the machine. An arcade template describes a

/// 2. **It silently broke FIRST-RUN.md moment 7.** No arcade template binds
///    `Guide` — a real panel has no spare button for it — so the default path
///    could not send the controller button that asks Windows to open Game Bar
///    when the user's Game Bar setting allows it.
///
/// # Why `keyboard-2p` and not `keyboard-wasd`
///
/// `keyboard-wasd` binds Guide and was the obvious pick, and it is wrong: it is
/// `players: 1`. Staging a second controller takes the layout's SECOND player
/// block, and a one-player layout has none — so slot 2 fell back to another
/// chart and the two collided on `D`. A test already guarded that ("two players
/// on one panel must not share a key") and caught it.
///
/// `keyboard-2p` is the two-player desktop layout, so slot 2 is a real second
/// half rather than a fallback — and it now binds Guide too (`LeftWindows` /
/// `NumpadAsterisk`), which it should have from the start: every persona
/// exposes Guide, so a desktop layout omitting it was an oversight rather than
