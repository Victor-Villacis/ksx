//! Kept apart from [`crate::ControlSource`] on purpose, and the split is
//! load-bearing (docs/M9-DECISION.md §6): ksx-backend's collectors read the config
//! store and the platform directly, which is why `ksx studio` renders a
//! read-only mapper behind the "No daemon" banner instead of an error page.
//! Merging the two traits would delete that path — a surface that needed a
//! write channel to render a preset would have nothing to render when the

//!
//! These types are presentation-shaped by design: the provider composes the
//! human-readable lines, a surface only places them. That is what lets one
//! contract serve a web page, a native window and an MCP tool without any of
//! them re-deriving a fourth wording for "installed — service running".
