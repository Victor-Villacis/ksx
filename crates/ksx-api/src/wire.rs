//! **The one place the JSON wire shapes are derived from.**
//!
//! Every ksx front end and the daemon itself read and write the daemon control
//! protocol through the types in this module. That is the whole point of the
//! layer: before it, a request was hand-built with `serde_json::json!` at the
//! caller and hand-parsed with `request.get("field")` at the daemon, and the
//! two descriptions of the same message lived 3,000 lines apart.
//!
//! On 2026-08-06 that cost a real bug: the `map-macro` body reader carried an
//! ALLOWLIST of body fields, `repeat` (and its `turbo_hz`/`gap_ms` rate) was
//! not on it, and a macro card that set `while-held` saved `once` — with a
//! cheerful "saved" toast, because nothing on either side could tell that a
//! field had been dropped on the way in. [`MapMacroRequest`] is the fix in
//! type form: its body half is `ksx_config::MacroFile` itself, serialized and
//! deserialized as a unit, so the wire's macro fields ARE the file's macro
//! fields and a field added to the table is on the wire the moment it
//! compiles. The list that remains is the ENVELOPE's (`verb`, `preset`,
//! `name`, `delete`, `reload`) — a closed set this module owns — and getting
//! that one wrong is loud (`MacroFile` is `deny_unknown_fields`, so a stray
//! envelope key is a refusal in words) instead of silent.
//!
//! The protocol itself is unchanged and stays deliberately dumb: one JSON
//! request line in, one JSON response line out, per connection
//! (docs/CONTROL-SURFACE.md).
