//! Stamp the Win32 resources into `ksx.exe`: the icon group and VERSIONINFO.
//!
//! Until this file existed, `ksx.exe` carried **no resources at all** — the
//! generic white-page icon in Explorer, in the taskbar, in the Open-With list
//! and in the UAC prompt, and a blank Details tab in its properties. The tray
//! could not do better than `LoadIconW(NULL, IDI_APPLICATION)` because there
//! was nothing in the binary to load.
//!
//! # The icon
//!
//! `assets/brand/dist/ksx.ico` — eight entries, and **not eight scalings of
//! one drawing**: 16/20/24/32 are the simplified mark, 48/64/128/256 the
//! detailed one (`tools/icongen`, `assets/brand/README.md`). Windows picks
//! the entry that fits the surface it is drawing, so the tray gets art drawn
//! for 16 px and the alt-tab switcher gets art drawn for 256 px.
//!
//! The group is stamped with resource id [`ICON_RESOURCE_ID`] = 1, which is
//! two contracts at once:
//!
//! - Explorer shows the icon group with the **numerically lowest** id, so 1
//!   is what makes this the file's face;
//! - `ksx_backend::daemon::tray` loads that same id out of its own module
//!   (`ksx-backend/src/daemon/tray.rs`, `ICON_RESOURCE_ID`). The two are the
//!   handshake; they are documented in terms of each other on both sides.
//!
//! # VERSIONINFO
//!
//! Version metadata is not decoration on this project. `ksx install-drivers`
//! reasons about Authenticode signatures and driver versions, `ksx doctor`
//! reports what is installed, and a support conversation that starts with
//! "right-click → Properties → Details" needs that tab to say something. The
//! version comes from `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` so it cannot drift from the crate.
//!
//! # When this actually runs
//!
//! Two conditions, checked separately because they are two different things:
//!
//! - the **target** must be Windows (`CARGO_CFG_TARGET_OS`) — a `.res` means
//!   nothing in an ELF binary, and ksx's lower crates do get
//!   `cargo check --target` runs;
//! - the **host** must be Windows (`cfg!(windows)` — a build script always
//!   runs natively). `winresource` is declared under
//!   `[target.'cfg(windows)'.build-dependencies]`, and Cargo resolves *that*
//!   table against the host, so the crate is not even linked into this script
//!   when it is built on Linux.
//!
//! So a Windows→Windows build gets the icon; a Linux→Windows cross-compile
//! produces a working, iconless `ksx.exe`. That is the same trade as the
//! `res.compile()` failure below, for the same reason: nothing about the
//! program's behaviour depends on the icon being there.
