//! ksx — split keyboards (I-PAC arcade encoders) into virtual Xbox 360 controllers.

// This file used to carry `#![cfg_attr(test, allow(dead_code))]`. In the test
// harness build, dead-code analysis loses `fn main` as a liveness root (rustc
// 1.97 sharpened this), so everything reachable only through the runtime path —
// the `dyn MachineSource` chain Studio drives, the onboard/profile-edit glue,
// every view-conversion helper no unit test calls — read as "never used" in
// that one target and nowhere else. All of that code is `ksx-backend`'s now,
// where `pub mod` makes it a liveness root in its own right, so the allow is
// gone rather than inherited: nothing left in this crate is reachable except
// through `main` or a test, and if that changes the lint should say so.

// Every verb this file dispatches to. These were `mod` declarations until the
// split; the bodies are `ksx-backend`'s now and this crate is the CLI and
// nothing else — argument definitions, the `match` below, and the exit codes.
// If you are adding logic rather than a flag, it does not go in this file.
