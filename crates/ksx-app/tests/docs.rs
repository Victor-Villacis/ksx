//! The design docs, as tests.
//!
//! # Why a test crate reads Markdown
//!
//! `docs/` is not reference material here — several files are *normative*, and
//! the code cites them by section number to explain why it refuses something.
//! That arrangement has two failure modes that no compiler catches:
//!
//! 1. **A renumber.** `docs/DEVICE-IDENTITY.md` is cited from twelve source
//!    files, around twenty-five times, by section number. Delete a section or
//!    insert one and every citation below it starts pointing at the wrong
//!    argument — silently, and only for the person reading the code at 2 a.m.
//! 2. **A doc drifting into a memo.** `docs/SURFACES.md` was written as a peer
//!    of `docs/CONTROL-SURFACE.md` and, at its first audit, had **zero**
//!    references anywhere in the repository while its peers had 8 to 106. A
//!    design document nothing points at is not consulted when the code it
//!    governs is written, and its rules get broken without anyone deciding to
//!    break them — which is exactly what that audit found.
//!
//! Neither test checks that a doc is *true*. Nothing can. They check the two
//! mechanical properties that keep a doc reachable, which is the precondition
//! for anyone noticing it is not true.
//!
//! The third test guards a specific promise rather than a mechanism, and it is
//! here because it is a documentation rule with a user-visible cost: the setup
//! docs must not teach someone to hand-author a device id.
