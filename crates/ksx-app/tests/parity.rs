//! **The surface-parity guard** — `docs/SURFACES.md` §1 and §3, as a test.
//!
//! # The two failures this exists for, and they are the same failure
//!
//! `ksx device pick` shipped as a verb with no web face and nobody noticed
//! until the owner opened the UI and found he could not list a board. That is
//! the obvious half. `docs/SURFACES.md` §1 records the other half, which is the
//! same shape pointed the other way: `MachineSource::devices()` was built for a
//! cabinet screen nobody ever wrote, and sat with **zero callers**, compiled
//! behind `#[cfg(all(windows, feature = "cabinet"))]` for a consumer that never
//! asks. A backend verb with no face is not finished — it is untested against a
//! real caller and its shape is a guess.
//!
//! §3's matrix is where those two are supposed to be reconciled. It is prose,
//! so it drifts: at its first audit **four** of its cells described capabilities
//! that did not exist, and two of them said "view" for a surface that renders
//! nothing at all — which reads as shipped. This file makes the matrix a claim
//! the tree either supports or does not.
//!
//! # What the guard checks against what
//!
//! Three evidence sources, none of them a list maintained by hand:
//!
//! | surface | evidence | read from |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | CLI | the clap command tree | the built binary, walked with `--help` |
//! | egui | `Screen::ALL` + every `Ask` variant | `ksx-cabinet/src/{nav,app}.rs`, by source text |
//! | Studio | every `.route()` inside `Router::new()` | `ksx-studio/src/server/mod.rs`, by source text |
//!
//! The two source-text readers work the way `ksx-backend/src/run/plan.rs`'s
//! source-guard test does, and for the same reason: the fact being checked is a
//! *structural* one that no value reachable at runtime reports. In Studio's case
//! the structure is load-bearing twice over — the scan stops at the guard layer
//! (`crate::guard::same_origin`), so a route declared after it, outside the CSRF
//! and DNS-rebinding checks, is invisible here and reads as a missing face.
//!
//! # Why the CLI is walked as a subprocess and not `Cli::command()`
//!
//! `ksx-app` has a `[[bin]]` and no `[lib]`. An integration test is its own
//! crate and can see a package's library types, never a binary's — so `Cli`,
//! `Command` and the derive output are not nameable from `tests/`. Walking the
//! binary's own `--help` is the same tree rendered by the same clap, which is
//! the property that matters: nothing here re-types a verb name. Give this
//! package a `[lib]` holding the CLI types and `walk_clap_tree` becomes eight
//! lines against `clap::CommandFactory`; until then this is the honest reading.
//!
//! The walk runs against a COPY of the binary in a temp directory with a
//! `ksx.toml` beside it, because `ksx` initialises logging before it parses
//! argv: the portable marker makes that temp directory the config root
//! (`ksx_config::ConfigRoot::resolve`), so forty `--help` runs write forty log
//! lines into a directory this test then deletes, instead of into the config
//! root of whoever is running the tests.
//!
//! # What the guard cannot see
//!
//! An `EXEMPT` verb, a cell with no anchor, and a face built under a name the
//! anchor table does not guess. The "nothing is there" direction is a tripwire
//! on the obvious name, not a proof — `/devices/pick` catches a device picker,
//! `/pick-a-board` would not. The "a face exists" direction is exact: the
//! anchors are read out of the tree, so a claim of a shipped face fails the
//! moment the thing backing it is gone.
//!
//! A profile CRUD row now names the still-planned CLI verbs explicitly, so the
//! guard no longer hides their absence inside configuration verbs that happen
//! to exist.
