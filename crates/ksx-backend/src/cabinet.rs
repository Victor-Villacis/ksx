//! `ksx cabinet` — hosting the 10-foot OPERATE surface (feature `cabinet`).
//!
//! `ksx-cabinet` draws; this module says what it is drawing. Three hosts, one
//! window:
//!
//! | host | control source | when |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | **inside `ksx daemon`** ([`spawn_in_daemon`]) | the daemon's OWN dispatch, called directly — no pipe, no socket, no second process | the tray's "Open cabinet UI" |
//! | **its own process** ([`run`]) | [`ksx_api::PipeTransport`] over `\\.\pipe\ksx-daemon` | `ksx cabinet`, the recovery path |
//! | **`--demo`** ([`run_demo`]) | fixtures that refuse every write in words | design review and screenshots |
//!
//! # The in-daemon source, and the thing it CANNOT do
//!
//! [`daemon_sink`] builds a second [`crate::daemon::pipe::PipeDeps`] and calls
//! [`crate::daemon::pipe::handle_request`] directly. That gives the window
//! exactly the tray's reach — the same `DaemonCommand` on the same channel,
//! the same `DaemonState` snapshot — with no IPC in the middle, which is the
//! property E7 wanted from a native UI (docs/M9-DECISION.md §6, the
//! `InProcess` row).
//!
//! Its preset writers are **refusals**, deliberately, and that is the
//! load-bearing detail: the cabinet OPERATES and Studio AUTHORS, so a cabinet
//! that ever tried to send `map`, `map-macro`, `map-restore`, `map-clear-all`
//! or `learn-key` is refused **by its own dispatch**, in words, naming the
//! surface that can. The rule is not a review checklist item; it is what this
//! table is wired to, and `tests::the_in_daemon_dispatch_refuses_every_
//! authoring_verb_in_words` asserts every entry of it.
//!
//! The one honest cost: `handle_request` takes a request LINE, so a verb is
//! serialized to a JSON string and parsed back inside one process. That is one
//! small allocation per human click, against a rate of a few clicks a minute —
//! the same measurement that decided M9 in the first place.
