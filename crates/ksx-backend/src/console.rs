//! Whether `ksx daemon` keeps the console window it was started from.
//!
//! # The problem
//!
//! `ksx.exe` is a console subsystem binary, and it has to stay one: the same
//! executable is `ksx devices`, `ksx doctor`, and `ksx run --dry-run`.
//! Marking it `#![windows_subsystem = "windows"]` would
//! silence every one of those — a CLI whose output goes nowhere. So the daemon
//! inherits a console window, and that window is a liability:
//!
//! - closing it kills the process, taking the tray icon and the session with it,
//!   and a black terminal beside a tray icon is *exactly* what a person clicks
//!   the X on;
//! - a Task Scheduler autostart of `ksx daemon` puts that window on the
//!   cabinet's game screen at every logon. (Note `ksx autostart --enable`
//!   registers `ksx run`, not the daemon, so this applies to a hand-registered
//!   daemon task — see the autostart module.)
//!
//! # The fix, and what used to be its cost
//!
//! `ksx daemon` (tray mode) calls `FreeConsole` once the icon is on screen:
//! after that there is no window to close and nothing to see.
//!
//! That used to cost the logs. The console is where tracing went, so from the
//! moment of detaching every `tracing::warn!`/`error!` in the process — REBOOT
//! REQUIRED, the capture watchdog, the Interception end-of-life notice, and a
//! panic message — was written to nothing, and a daemon that died left no trace
//! anywhere. [`crate::logging`] closed that: the same lines also go to a daily
//! rotating file under the config root, and a panic hook puts a dying daemon's
//! last words there too. So
//! [`detach_notice`] now *names the file* instead of apologising — and still
//! says the old thing, loudly, in the one case where it is true again: no log
//! file could be opened.
//!
//! Two escape hatches, both keeping the console:
//!
//! - `--console` — debugging, and the only way to watch a daemon session live;
//! - `--headless` — **stdin is its control surface**. Detaching would close the
//!   one channel that mode has, so it is never detached, whatever else is asked.
