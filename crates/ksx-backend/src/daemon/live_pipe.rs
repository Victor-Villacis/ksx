//! ```
//!
//! # Why this is a second pipe and not a verb on the control pipe
//!
//! The full argument is on [`ksx_api::LiveSource`], where every client can
//! read it. The one that decided it, from this side: **the control pipe serves
//! connections sequentially, on one thread.** A connection held open to carry
//! frames would hold that thread for as long as the tab was open, and `status`
//! / `start` / `stop` would never be answered again. One browser tab would
//! take the daemon's whole control surface down with it.
//!
//! So this channel is the opposite shape on purpose: **one thread per
//! connection**, each owning its own subscription for the connection's life.
//! The two pipes also fail independently, which is the property that matters
//! at a cabinet — a wedged live feed must never stop you pressing Stop.
//!
//! # Backpressure, end to end, with exactly one counter
//!
//! Every buffer in the chain is bounded and the whole chain is *blocking*
//! after the first hop, which is what lets one number stay true:
//!
//! - engine → subscription: `try_send` on a bounded queue. Full means the
//!   event is dropped and this subscriber's `dropped` counter moves. **This is
//!   the only lossy hop, and it is the one that reports.** The engine never
//!   waits (`crate::feed`, property 2).
//! - subscription → pipe: this module's per-connection thread polls and
//!   blocks in `WriteFile`. A stalled reader parks THIS thread, whose
//!   subscription queue then fills, so the loss is counted at the hop above
//!   and reported to this same consumer in the next frame that gets through.
//! - pipe → Studio → browser: Studio's bridge blocks too, for the same reason
//!   and with the same effect.
//!
//! A tab that stops reading therefore grows no queue anywhere, slows nothing,
//! and is TOLD what it missed. That last part is the whole point: a button
//! check that silently skipped the press you just made is worse than one that
//! says it did.
//!
//! # Lifetime
//!
//! Closing the tab drops the SSE stream → Studio's bridge thread ends → the
//! pipe handle closes → this thread's `WriteFile` fails → the thread returns →
//! the `LiveSubscription` drops → `unsubscribe`. With the last viewer gone the
//! sink's gate closes and the pipeline is back to paying one relaxed atomic
//! load per event. The chain has no step that needs anyone to remember it.
