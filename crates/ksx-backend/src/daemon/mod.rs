//! `ksx daemon` — ksx that stays resident, with a tray icon.

//! # Shape
//!
//! ```text
//! [tray thread]     its own window + message pump. Owns the Shell_NotifyIconW
//!                   icon and the popup menu. Sends DaemonCommands. Never
//!                   touches the pipeline, the config, or a driver.
//!        │ crossbeam channel
//!        ▼
//! [control thread]  this module. Owns the session lifecycle: start, stop,
//!                   reload, quit. Blocks freely.
//!        │ spawns
//!        ▼
//! [session thread]  one `supervise()` call = one emulation session, exactly
//!                   the M4 pipeline with nothing added.
//! ```
//!
//! The separation is the point. The tray is a Win32 message pump, but no
//! keystroke is dispatched through it. The tray thread has no path to the
//! capture thread at all — it can only enqueue a command. If it
//! hangs, the session keeps running and every emergency escape still works,
//! because escapes are evaluated inside the capture thread.
//!
//! # Headless
//!
//! `--headless` skips the tray and offers the identical control surface on
//! stdin (`start`, `stop`, `reload`, `config`, `status`, `quit`). Same control
//! loop, same commands, same state — the tray is a front end for it, not a
//! parallel implementation. That is what makes the tray droppable if it ever
//! misbehaves, and what makes the control loop testable in CI.
//!
//! A third front end, the [`pipe`] named-pipe server, gives OTHER processes
//! (`ksx session`, Studio) exactly the tray's reach and no more: enqueue a
//! [`DaemonCommand`], read the [`DaemonState`] snapshot. See that module for
//! the protocol and the trust model.
//!
//! # M6: the daemon owns the panel
//!
//! With the Interception backend the daemon is a convenience — between sessions
//! every keyboard is an ordinary keyboard whether ksx runs or not. With a
//! WinUSB-claimed panel that is no longer true: the claimed interface is not in
//! the keyboard stack, so **something has to put its keystrokes back**, and the
//! only thing that can is ksx. [`typethrough::TypethroughService`] does it, and
//! this control loop decides when: [`PanelKeyboard::set_emulating`] is called
//! `true` before a session starts and `false` after it is reaped. That ordering
//! is contractual and asserted in CI — see
//! [`tests::the_panel_stops_typing_before_a_session_starts_and_resumes_after_it_ends`].
//!
//! The claim itself is made **once**, by [`run`], before this loop starts, and
//! lives in a [`panel::Panel`] for the whole life of the process. Sessions
//! borrow it through `Panel::session_backend` (`crate::capture::build_session`);
//! `supervise()` starts and stops that borrowed view per session while the claim
//! underneath never moves. Interception-backed devices are unchanged: their
//! backend is still created and destroyed per session, because between sessions
//! the OS owns them and ksx has nothing to do.
//!
//! End to end, that path is asserted in [`panel_tests`]: two real sessions over
//! one mock-backed claim, with the panel typing in between.
