//! The M6 daemon contract, driven end to end: **one claim, many sessions**.
//!
//! These tests exist because the ones next to them did not catch the bug they
//! were written for. `daemon::tests` drives the control loop against a
//! `RecordingPanel` that only writes strings into a log, so it kept passing
//! while the production wiring handed the loop a `NoPanel` and every session
//! built (and dropped) its own WinUSB claim. Everything the panel is *for* —
//! the claim outliving the session, the typethrough typing in between, the
//! keys reaching the engine through a borrowed claim — was invisible to it.
//!
//! So nothing here is a stand-in for the thing under test:
//!
//! | piece | what runs |
//! |---|---|
//! | control loop | the real [`control_loop_with`] |
//! | panel | the real [`Panel`], with its real typethrough thread |
//! | session capture | the real `crate::capture::build_session`, borrowing that panel |
//! | session | the real `supervise()` — real engine, real teardown order |
//! | injector | [`RecordingInjector`] — a log instead of `SendInput` |
//! | pads | `ksx_output::MockBackend` |
//! | the claim | [`WireClaim`]: a `CaptureBackend` over a channel the test drives |
//!
//! `WireClaim` is the only substitution, and it substitutes exactly one thing:
//! the USB endpoint. It is opened once, counted, and observed for release —
//! which is precisely the property "the daemon owns the claim for its whole
//! lifetime" makes a claim about.
