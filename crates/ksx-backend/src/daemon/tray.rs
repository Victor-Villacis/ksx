//! The notification-area icon: a hand-rolled `Shell_NotifyIconW` on a thread
//! of its own.
//!
//! # Why not a tray crate
//!
//! `ksx-backend` already links `windows-sys`, and the whole API surface needed here
//! is five functions and one message loop. A crate for this would add a
//! dependency tree (and, in most cases, an event-loop framework) to a project
//! whose entire premise is that the input path must be boring and auditable.
//! It would also blur the one property that matters below.
//!
//! # The property that matters
//!
//! This thread cannot reach the hot path. Structurally — not by convention:
//!
//! - it owns no channel to the capture thread, the engine thread or the output
//!   thread. Its only outbound edge is a `Sender<DaemonCommand>`;
//! - it never calls into `ksx-capture`, `ksx-core` or `ksx-output`;
//! - it reads state through one `Mutex<DaemonState>` it holds for the length of
//!   a `clone()`.
//!
//! That separation is deliberate: no keystroke is dispatched through the UI
//! thread. A tray thread that hangs therefore costs you a menu, not a keyboard.
//! Emulation keeps running, and `LeftCtrl ×5` still frees the keyboards,
//! because escapes are evaluated inside the capture thread.
//!
//! # Testing
//!
//! There is nothing here to unit-test — it is a message pump around six Win32
//! calls. Everything with a decision in it (which item leads and is therefore
//! drawn in bold, which items are enabled, what the tooltip says, what each
//! command does) lives in the parent module and is tested there. This file's
//! correctness is established by running it.
