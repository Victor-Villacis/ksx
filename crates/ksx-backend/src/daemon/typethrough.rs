//! The claimed-panel keyboard: what makes a WinUSB claim survivable.
//!
//! # The problem M6 creates
//!
//! A WinUSB-claimed interface is not a keyboard. Windows sees nothing from it —
//! that is the point, and it is why blocking becomes free and structural. But
//! LaunchBox and RetroBat navigate their menus with keystrokes, so **the moment
//! emulation stops, the panel goes dead**, and if ksx is not running at all it
//! was never alive.
//!
//! # The answer
//!
//! ksx holds the claim continuously and puts the keystrokes back itself
//! whenever it is not translating them:
//!
//! ```text
//!            emulation stopped                      emulation running
//!            ─────────────────                      ─────────────────
//!  panel ──▶ capture ──▶ Typethrough ──▶ SendInput   panel ──▶ capture ──▶ engine ──▶ pads
//!                        (types)                       (Typethrough muted, forwards)
//! ```
//!
//! The daemon (M5) is what guarantees ksx is always running: `ksx autostart
//! --enable` registers `ksx daemon` at logon, and the daemon owns the claim for
//! its whole lifetime rather than per-session ([`super::panel`]). That ownership
//! inversion is the structural difference between the Interception era and this
//! one — see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §M6.
//!
//! # This thread is the panel's *only* injector, and the fork in the road
//!
//! One thread drains the claim's event stream, and it does two things with each
//! event: hands it to [`Typethrough`] (which types it, or does not, depending on
//! the mode) and — while a session is attached — forwards it to that session's
//! capture channel. Both duties live here on purpose:
//!
//! - **One held-key set.** If the capture backend injected for itself *and* a
//!   typethrough injected too, the panel would have two independent records of
//!   what Windows believes is held down, and every mode switch would be a chance
//!   to strand a key. The daemon therefore builds its claim with
//!   [`ksx_platform::inject::NullInjector`] and lets this thread do all of it.
//! - **No gap and no double.** Muting/unmuting is one state change on one
//!   thread, acknowledged before [`TypethroughCtl::set_emulating`] returns —
//!   there is no window in which both injectors are live, because there is only
//!   ever one.
//!
//! # Emergency escapes still bypass everything
//!
//! `LeftCtrl ×5` is detected in the capture thread and latched in the shared
//! [`EscapeHandle`]. This thread reads that latch **live, per event** (one
//! relaxed atomic load), exactly as `ksx_capture::winusb` does: a gesture puts
//! the panel back to typing on the very next key, with no supervisor, no control
//! message, and nothing that a wedged session could starve.
//!
//! # The failure mode, stated honestly
//!
//! If ksx is not running, a WinUSB-claimed panel does nothing at all. No
//! keystrokes, no menu, no way to type the release command from that panel.
//! That is the price of escaping the 2026 cross-signed driver cliff, and the
//! mitigations are exactly two: autostart, and the one-command rollback
//! (`ksx winusb release <device> --yes`, or the `pnputil` lines in
//! `docs/RECOVERY.md` §2 for when ksx itself will not start). Injected keys also
//! never reach the secure desktop, which is why `ksx winusb claim` refuses to
//! take the machine's last keyboard.
