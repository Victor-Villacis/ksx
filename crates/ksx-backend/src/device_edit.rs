//! `ksx device pick` and `ksx device remove` — the write half of the device
//! picker.
//!
//! [`crate::device_scan`] is the read half: it groups interfaces into physical
//! boards and prints what ksx *would* write. This is what writes it, and it is
//! a separate verb precisely so that looking is never a commitment.
//!
//! # One writer, like every other write
//!
//! Same shape as [`crate::slots`]: a typed spec in, a pure plan out, a
//! timestamped backup taken before the write, and the store's atomic save doing
//! the I/O. [`plan_pick`] and [`plan_remove`] take a `Survey` and a slice of
//! [`DeviceFacts`] rather than reaching for hardware, so every refusal below is
//! exercised in CI against a synthetic device tree, on any platform.
//!
//! # Picking is not claiming (`docs/DEVICE-IDENTITY.md` §7)
//!
//! A WinUSB claim takes a keyboard *off the Windows input stack*. On a machine
//! whose only keyboard is that board, an automatic claim is a lockout — and a
//! lockout the user cannot type their way out of. So `pick` writes config,
//! prints `ksx winusb claim <ID>` as an explicit next step, and stops.
//!
//! The corollary that is easy to get backwards: `backend = "winusb"` describes
//! what an interface **is**, never what it could become. Setting it because an
//! interface merely *could* be claimed turns a working Interception keyboard
//! into a config that refuses to start, in one command that looked like a menu
//! choice.
//!
//! # Removing an entry does not release a board
//!
//! `remove` deletes four lines of TOML. The driver binding is a property of the
//! machine, not of ksx's config, so a claimed board stays claimed — Windows
//! still sees no keyboard on it, and now there is no config entry left to
//! explain why. That warning is the whole reason `remove` looks at the device
//! tree at all.

/// So the paragraph states what is true of every port-rung entry — it matches
