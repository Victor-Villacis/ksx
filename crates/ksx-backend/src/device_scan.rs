//! `ksx device scan` — what is plugged in, grouped the way a person thinks
//! about it.
//!
//! # Why this exists beside `ksx devices`
//!
//! `ksx devices` answers "what can the capture layer see", one row per devnode,
//! and that is the right shape for diagnosing a backend. It is the wrong shape
//! for CHOOSING. On the representative setup it prints 29 USB interfaces; three of
//! them are one I-PAC, one is a trackball, and the rest are a mouse, an AURA
//! controller, a fan controller, an audio device and — until `ksx pads --prune`
//! is run — fifteen of ksx's own virtual pads.
//!
//! Nobody picks a keyboard out of that. So this groups interfaces into the
//! physical boards they belong to, names each board, says which one interface
//! is the keyboard, and shows what ksx would write if you picked it.
//!
//! Read-only and daemon-free. It enumerates and prints; it opens nothing,
//! claims nothing, and writes nothing. `ksx device pick` is the writer, and it
//! is a separate verb precisely so that looking is never a commitment.
