//! constructing an `InterceptionBackend` never sets a class filter (see its

//! enumerate` opens nothing and claims nothing (see its module docs). Running
//! this command mid-session cannot disturb a keystroke.
//!
//! Exit codes (documented in `--help`): 0 = listed, 1 = error,
//! [`EXIT_DRIVER_MISSING`] (2) = **nothing** could be enumerated — neither the

//! own is no longer fatal here: after the M6 rebind the whole point is that
//! ksx runs with Interception uninstalled, and a command that refused to list
//! anything in that state would be useless exactly when it is needed most.
//!
//! The health line is the *static* slot-exhaustion check: budget usage plus
//! any keyboard sitting outside the 1..=10 slot range. Id-climb detection
//! needs observation history (two identical boards legitimately occupy two
//! slots), so the climb detector runs only inside a live capture session —
