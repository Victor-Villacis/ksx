//! **The live fan-out sink: one lossy stream, many consumers.**
//!
//! [`ksx_api::live`] is the *shape*; this is the plumbing. One sink is created
//! per daemon and lives for the daemon's whole life; each session publishes
//! into it while it runs; each surface subscribes to it and pulls at display
//! rate.

//! ```
//!
//! # The three properties, and how each one is structural rather than promised
//!
//! **1. Nobody subscribed costs nothing measurable.** Every publish opens with
//! one `Relaxed` load of an `AtomicUsize` and returns. No `ArcSwap::load`, no
//! branch on a `Vec`, no allocation — the whole call is a load, a compare and a
//! ret, and it inlines. That is what lets the tap sit in the engine thread's
//! delta funnel at all: a cabinet with no window open runs exactly the pipeline
//! it ran before this module existed.
//!
//! **2. A slow consumer can never backpressure the engine.** Delivery is
//! `try_send` on a BOUNDED channel. Full means the event is dropped and a
//! counter moves; the counter is reported to that consumer in its next frame,
//! so loss is visible rather than silent. Same rule as the M4 delta coalescing
//! and E7's "a slow browser can never backpressure the engine".
//!
//! **3. There is no callback anywhere.** The sink holds `Sender`s, never
//! closures. A wedged UI thread wedges itself; the pipeline notices nothing
//! but a full queue. This is the CONTROL-SURFACE invariant that the tray, the
//! pipe and this sink all satisfy.
//!
//! # Coalescing is the CONSUMER's job, on purpose
//!
//! The producer publishes every transition; [`LiveSubscription::poll`] folds
//! whatever has arrived into one [`LiveFrame`]. Doing it the other way round —
//! sampling the pipeline at 60 Hz — would silently drop a button tap shorter
//! than 16 ms, and "I pressed it and nothing lit" is the exact sentence the
//! button check exists to answer. Instead every intermediate state is folded
//! into [`ksx_api::SlotLive::hit`], so a 4 ms tap is invisible in `down` and
//! unmistakable in `hit`.

// **This used to say "in a build with no UI feature there is nothing that can
// call `subscribe`". That stopped being true when the live pipe landed**:
// `crate::daemon::live_pipe` subscribes per connection and is compiled into
// EVERY Windows build, feature flags or not, because its consumer (Studio, the
// E8 bus) is a separate process rather than a linked window.
//
// What is left is the NON-WINDOWS build, where there is no named pipe to serve
// and no egui window either, so the fold and the frame builder really are
// unreachable. They are still compiled there, and that is deliberate: the
// producer half must be byte-identical in every build — a feature flag that
// changes pipeline code is a feature flag that changes what CI tested — so the
// unreachability is stated here rather than papered over with a `cfg` that
// would fork the file.
