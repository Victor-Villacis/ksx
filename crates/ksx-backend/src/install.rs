//! `ksx install-drivers` — the one command that runs with an administrator
//! token, and therefore the one with the strictest rules.
//!
//! The decision table, the search-path policy, the two identity pins and the
//! sealed-handle execution all live in `ksx_platform::installer`. This file is
//! the command around them: it reports what is on the machine, seals and
//! verifies the bundle, prints the verdict, and — only with an explicit
//! `--yes` — executes.
//!
//! # What it will not do
//!
//! - **Self-elevate.** A process that quietly relaunches itself as
//!   administrator teaches users to click through UAC prompts they did not ask
//!   for. If elevation is needed, ksx says so and stops.
//! - **Download anything.** Ever. The bundled file is the only artefact, and
//!   its SHA-256 and Authenticode signer are pinned in `docs/DRIVERS.md`.
//! - **Run a file that failed verification**, or tell you how to run it
//!   yourself.
//! - **Install Interception.** Its licence is non-commercial and its installer
//!   is not ours to redistribute; ksx reports its state and points at
//!   `docs/DRIVERS.md`.
//!
//! # Exit codes
//!
//! | 0 | nothing to do, or the installer ran and succeeded |
//! | 1 | unexpected error |
//! | 2 | refused: verification failed, the bundle is missing, or elevation is required |
//! | 3 | the installer ran and returned a non-zero exit code |
