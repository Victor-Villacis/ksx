//! Where ksx's log lines go — including the last one it ever writes.
//!
//! # The problem this exists for
//!
//! Until now every `tracing` line in the workspace went to **stderr and nowhere
//! else**. That is fine for `ksx devices` in a terminal and useless for the
//! thing ksx actually is: a daemon on an arcade cabinet, started by a scheduled
//! task, that releases its console the moment the tray icon appears
//! (`crate::console`). From that instant stderr is `NUL`. A daemon that died at
//! 3am — Interception slot exhaustion, a wedged consumer, a panic — left
//! **nothing behind at all**, and the three messages a user most needs
//! ("REBOOT REQUIRED", "event consumer stalled — forcing passthrough", the
//! Interception end-of-life notice) were written to a black hole.
//!
//! So: a daily-rolling file sink alongside stderr for **every** command — a
//! `ksx run` on the cabinet should leave a log too, not just the daemon.
//!
//! # Four properties, each of which is load-bearing
//!
//! - **stdout is never touched.** `--json` promises exactly one object on
//!   stdout, and one log line landing there corrupts it for every automated
//!   caller. Both sinks here are stderr and a file; nothing writes to stdout.
//! - **The writer is non-blocking, and the guard outlives the process.**
//!   `tracing-appender`'s classic footgun is `let _ = non_blocking(..)`, which
//!   drops the [`WorkerGuard`] immediately and silently stops logging forever.
//!   The guard goes into [`GUARD`], a `static` that is never dropped, so it
//!   cannot be lost by a refactor that changes what `main` holds.
//! - **It is bounded on disk.** [`KEEP_DAYS`] days, pruned when the appender
//!   opens and at every rollover. A cabinet must not fill its system drive with
//!   its own diagnostics.
//! - **A panic reaches the file.** [`install_panic_hook`] logs the panic
//!   *before* the unwind, which is the whole point: the one event that explains
//!   why the daemon is gone is the one the default hook writes to a stderr that
//!   does not exist.
//!
//! # Portable mode
//!
//! The directory comes from [`ksx_config::ConfigRoot::logs_dir`], so a portable
//! install (a `ksx.toml` next to the exe — arcade cabs love those) logs beside
//! the exe and an installed one logs to `%APPDATA%\ksx\logs\`. One rule, no
//! second discovery path to disagree with the first.
//!
//! # Two ksx processes, one file
//!
//! `ksx devices` run while a daemon is resident writes to the same file: the
//! appender opens it with `append`, and each event is one `write_all`, so the
//! lines interleave but do not corrupt each other. That is the right trade for
//! a cabinet — a single chronological file is what somebody debugging one
//! actually wants, and per-process files would leave the interesting one
//! unnamed.
