//! The one mapping writer: `ksx map`, the daemon's pipe `map` verb and (through
//! it) Studio's mapper all call [`apply`] — no surface gets a private editing
//! path (docs/CONTROL-SURFACE.md's standing rule).
//!
//! Semantics:
//!
//! - **Replace per function.** `map --function A --key G` makes G the ONLY key
//!   bound to A. It replaces the KEYS OF ONE FUNCTION and nothing else: the
//!   same key on OTHER functions is left exactly where it is (see multi-bind,
//!   below).
//! - **A function may be given a KEY LIST** — many keys → one control, the
//!   OR-chain the engine has always executed (`A = ["S", "Enter"]`,
//!   docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §1a). `--key S --key Enter` (or `--key S,Enter`,
//!   or the pipe's `"keys": ["S","Enter"]`) writes the WHOLE list in ONE
//!   write, so the mapper's "add another key" / per-key ✕ are atomic instead
//!   of read-modify-write. The caller's ORDER is kept and DUPLICATES are
//!   dropped (first occurrence wins; `s` and `S` are the same key, because the
//!   list is deduped after each name is resolved). A one-key list is exactly
//!   the old single-key write, byte for byte. `"key"` and `"keys"` are two
//!   spellings of the same field, so giving both is refused rather than
//!   guessed.
//! - **One key may drive many functions — that is a MULTI-BIND, not a
//!   conflict.** The engine has no uniqueness constraint in either direction:
//!   "many keys → one function and one key → many functions are both native"
//!   (`ksx-core/src/preset.rs`, docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §1a) — one key
//!   compiles to a `SmallVec` of targets and they all fire together. So
//!   writing G to A when G is already this preset's B leaves B alone, writes
//!   A, and REPORTS the co-binding (`also_drives: ["B"]`) as information.
//!   That is what makes the mapper's "Map all to one key" work: N ordinary
//!   writes of one key, and all N stick (MAPPER-UX commandment 7 — duplicates
//!   are information, fan-out is the product).
//! - **MACROS ARE THE ONE EXCEPTION, and it is not an inconsistency.** Binding
//!   `macro.B` to a key that already starts `macro.A` in the SAME preset is
//!   REFUSED before any write ([`MapError::MacroTriggerTaken`]), naming both
//!   macros and the key, with `--force` to do it anyway. A binding is
//!   declarative STATE — two keys setting one bit, or one key setting two, are
//!   both well-defined, which is exactly why duplicates are information here. A
//!   macro is an imperative TIMELINE, and two timelines started together do not
//!   compose into a third: they interleave, and the game reads a superposition
//!   containing states no single step list has. Fan-out is the product for
//!   state and a bug for time. Cross-slot and cross-preset sharing stay legal —
//!   two players pressing one key is fan-out again.
//! - **`--clear`** leaves the function in the file bound to the inert `"None"`
//!   placeholder — the same convention as the built-in empty preset, so a
//!   cleared control stays visible instead of silently vanishing. Guarded rows
//!   (chords) are replaced/cleared by the same rule, so a cleared control is
//!   really cleared and never keeps a chord the engine still obeys.
//! - **Chords** (`when`/`unless`, docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §1b) write a
//!   GUARDED binding: "this function, but only while these other keys are (or
//!   are not) also held". Two deliberate differences from a plain write:
//!   a chord **never conflicts** (layering it over keys that already do
//!   something is the point, and stealing from them would destroy what the
//!   chord sits on), and it reports a **flash advisory** instead — one entry
//!   per constituent that is also individually bound, because ksx does not
//!   defer input and the game will see that binding for a moment before the
//!   chord completes. Guards that cannot mean anything (the trigger in its own
//!   guard, a key required and forbidden at once, a guard with no key) are
//!   refused before any write.
//! - **`--move-from FUNCTION` is the only way this verb unbinds anything it
//!   was not asked to bind**, and it names its victim out loud: it takes THIS
//!   key away from THAT one function (which keeps a `"None"` placeholder if
//!   that emptied it) and touches nothing else. Never implicit, never a side
//!   effect of `force`. The response says exactly what it unbound
//!   (`moved_from`).
//! - **The one remaining conflict is CROSS-SLOT, and it blocks** (the PadForge
//!   gap this closes — docs/research/padforge-code-audit.md §1.2 "Conflict
//!   handling: none"): the key is also bound in ANOTHER slot's preset, in a
//!   slot list that also uses the target preset. **A machine has two such
//!   lists and both are searched**: config.toml's `[[slot]]` table (the panel
//!   whenever no profile was chosen — `ksx run`, the daemon with no `--game`)
//!   and each games.toml profile (the panel for one title). Reading only the
//!   profiles is why a collision with a live `[[slot]]` used to come back "no
//!   conflict"; every conflict row now names the FILE and the slot that holds
//!   it, because "somewhere else" is not an address. `force` is the caller
//!   saying "yes, I mean both slots to see that key" — it writes the target,
//!   keeps reporting the double binding, and **never edits the other preset**,
//!   because silently rewriting a file the caller did not name is worse than a
//!   double binding the response spells out. `force` therefore removes no
//!   binding, anywhere, ever: it is an acknowledgement, not a hammer. (The
//!   genuinely destructive verbs are their own: [`clear_all`] and [`restore`],
//!   each of which takes a timestamped backup first.)
//! - **Writes are canonical.** The store serializes `PresetFile` afresh:
//!   bindings come back sorted with flat quoted dotted keys (`"dpad.up"`), and
//!   hand-written comments do not survive. That is the documented trade for
//!   atomic, validated writes (store.rs); the file remains hand-editable.
