///
/// Everything here is the DECISION half — pure, total, and tested in CI with
/// no ViGEmBus anywhere near it, exactly like [`plan_prune`] above. The only
/// Windows-only thing in the module is [`plug_and_hold`], which is the driver
/// plumbing the decision authorises.
///
/// Three properties the console versions got for free and a surface does not:
///
/// - **An end.** `ksx pads` holds the pattern until `--hold-secs` expires or
///   the user presses Ctrl+C. A web page has neither, so the hold is part of
///   the spec and every plug schedules its own unplug.
/// - **A judgement about the session.** The CLI trusts whoever typed the
///   command to know emulation is stopped. Nothing on a page carries that
///   knowledge, so [`plan_spawn`] refuses while a session is live — the same
///   refusal, and for the same reason, [`plan_prune`] already makes.
/// - **A total.** A console operator sees the pads accumulate and stops. A
///   button does not: five submits of `count=16` leave eighty pads on the bus
///   for two minutes, and the recovery — a prune — is refused to the
///   unelevated process a browser-launched Studio usually is. So
///   [`SpawnPlan::BusFull`] bounds the TOTAL, not the request, and
///   [`spawn_offer`] stops offering counts that would not fit.
///
/// What it deliberately does NOT do is refuse a count above the XInput
/// ceiling. `ksx pads --count 8 --persona xbox360` plugs eight pads and four
/// of them are invisible to every game; that stayed a WARNING when task #16
/// landed — plugging dead pads on purpose to see what Windows does with them
/// is a legitimate thing to ask a test command for, and the config layer is
/// where the same ceiling refuses. What this adds is the sentence saying so,
/// attached to the option that would cause it, so a surface can warn BEFORE
/// the click without knowing why four is the number — and NAMING the persona
/// it applies to, because the same click costs nothing on a HID pad. The
