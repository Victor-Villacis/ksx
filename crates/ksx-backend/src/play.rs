//! `ksx play` — replay a recorded session, live.
//!
//! `ksx monitor --record` writes a timeline; this plays it back into the real
//! pipeline. The session that results is an ordinary one in every respect —
//! same plan, same presets, same personas, same pads, same teardown order — and
//! the only difference is that its [`ksx_capture::CaptureBackend`] reads a file
//! instead of a driver. That is deliberate: a replay is worth having exactly
//! because it is *not* a special path. What it drives is what a player drives.
//!
//! # The one hard problem: a recording names devices that may not exist
//!
//! A recorded id is the id the board had **when the recording was made**. After
//! a replug it can be a different string for the same board; on another machine
//! it names nothing at all. So a recording is resolved before anything is
//! plugged, through the same selector path a session uses
//! ([`crate::run::resolve`], `docs/DEVICE-IDENTITY.md` §9), and `--as` remaps a
//! recorded device onto a configured one.
//!
//! The refusal rule mirrors the one `crate::run::resolve::drop_missing` argues
//! for, and for the same reason: a recorded device that drives no slot is
//! *noted and ignored*, because that is precisely what an unassigned keyboard
//! does in a live session — a recording may include a desk keyboard that was
//! never bound to anything. But a recording where **nothing** drives a slot
//! is refused before the pads are plugged, naming every recorded id and the
//! flag that fixes it. Starting that session would plug four pads and move none
//! of them, which is the "reports success while the panel is dead" failure this
//! project has a landmine entry about.
//!
//! # Live input is suppressed while a recording plays
//!
//! The driven boards are captured exactly as `ksx run` captures them — so their
//! keystrokes do not reach Windows — and their events are discarded rather than
//! merged into the timeline ([`ksx_capture::Silenced`]). Mixing the two means
//! the player at the panel fights the recording, in the game, where the game
//! sees both. The emergency escapes still work, because the silenced backend is
//! a real one watching the real board and shares this session's latch.
