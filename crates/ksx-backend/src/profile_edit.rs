//! Creating a `[[game]]` profile — the write half of games.toml.
//!
//! # Why this module exists at all
//!
//! Every other thing a person can do to their configuration had a verb.
//! Creating a PROFILE did not, and the gap was not obvious from any one
//! surface: `ksx setup` writes into a profile and bails with `no games.toml
//! profile called "…"` when it is absent, `ksx config import` replaces the
//! whole file, `ksx slot assign` edits slots inside a profile that already
//! exists. So the only supported way to get a first profile was to write TOML
//! by hand, and the reported symptom was exactly that — *"I can't create a new
//! profile"*.
//!
//! # One writer, like every other write
//!
//! Same shape as [`crate::device_edit`] and [`crate::slots`]: a typed spec in,
//! a pure plan out, a timestamped backup taken before the write, and the
//! store's atomic save doing the I/O. [`plan_new`] takes the LOADED
//! `ConfigFile`, `GamesFile`, and preset names rather than reaching for a
//! store, so every refusal below is exercised in CI on any platform, with no
//! config root and no disk.
//!
//! # Slots are seeded, and that is not a convenience
//!
//! A `[[game]]` with no `[[game.slot]]` entries hands out no pads. `ksx run
//! --game` refuses it, and the profile list will show it as usable. "Create"
//! that produced an empty shell would answer "I can't make a profile" with a
//! profile that cannot be played — so [`NewProfile::slots`] is required and
//! every seeded slot names a preset that is on disk (checked here, not at
//! launch).
//!
//! # A profile starts from the setup that already works
//!
//! Each seeded game slot inherits the matching base `[[slot]]`'s keyboard and
//! mouse selectors. `None` is not "any keyboard" in the run planner: a slot
//! with neither selector is skipped as `NoInputDeviceSelected`, and a profile
//! made entirely of those slots cannot play. The persona, SOCD mode, macro
//! switch, and config-wide blocking choices come along too; those are parts of
//! the working controller setup and the create form does not ask replacements.
//! The preset is the exception: the form explicitly chooses it, so that answer
//! is applied to every seeded slot.
