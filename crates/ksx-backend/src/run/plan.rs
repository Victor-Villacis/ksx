//! Config → runnable plan.
//!
//! One pure function ([`build_plan`]) turns already-loaded config/games/presets
//! into everything `ksx run` needs: resolved slots (device ids + real presets),
//! block flags, and the exact set of devices that may ever be captured. All the
//! refusal policy lives here so `--dry-run` and a live run agree by
//! construction.
//!
//! Refusal rules (blocking scope is a safety invariant, not a preference):
//! - `ksx_config::validate` issues ⇒ refuse to start, print them, exit 2.
//!   Loading is lenient; *starting emulation* is not.
//! - only devices bound to a slot may be captured, and in M4 only keyboards:
//!   the mouse class filter is never set, so a slot's mouse is routed but never
//!   blocked.
//! - a slot with no input device at all is dropped with
//!   [`InvalidationReason::NoInputDeviceSelected`] rather than silently
//!   plugging a pad nothing can drive.
