//! One resolution pass: `[[device]]` spellings → the concrete interfaces that
//! answer to them, right now (`docs/DEVICE-IDENTITY.md` §9 item 2).
//!
//! # What this replaces
//!
//! A `[[device]] id` used to be a raw string that was byte-compared against
//! enumerated hardware, deep in the pipeline, in four separate places. Which
//! meant the id had to *be* a devnode path — a value the user cannot author,
//! cannot verify, and whose stability depends on whether their board happens to
//! report a USB serial (`docs/DEVICE-IDENTITY.md` §1, measured in §3). When it
//! stopped matching, for that reason or any other, the config named nothing: no
//! error, no warning, a dead panel and a plan whose candidate list was simply
//! empty several layers down.
//!
//! Now the config holds a selector, and exactly one pass — this one — turns
//! each selector into the id the rest of the session uses. Everything
//! downstream keeps comparing concrete ids byte-exactly, unchanged.
//!
//! # Three outcomes, and none of them is a guess
//!
//! - [`Match::One`] — proceed, rewriting the plan's ids to the matched devnode.
//! - [`Match::None`] — **degrade, naming the board**, at the top, before
//!   anything is claimed or filtered: the slot that needed it is dropped with a
//!   `[WARN]`, everyone else plays, and the refusal comes only when no slot
//!   survives. An earlier draft of this list said "refuse" flatly, and so did
//!   `docs/DEVICE-IDENTITY.md` §9 item 2 — but one loose cable behind an
//!   eight-player cabinet must not blank the machine for everybody. See
//!   [`drop_missing`] for the whole argument.
//! - [`Match::Ambiguous`] — refuse, listing every hit *and* the port-pinned
//!   selector that would separate each one. Never pick. Two identical boards
//!   staying tellable apart is the entire reason WinUSB capture beats
//!   Interception, and silently taking the first would give that away with a
//!   friendlier face.
//!
//! # Where it runs, and why exactly there
//!
//! Inside [`crate::run::plan::resolve_as`], which is the one call
//! `LiveFactory::make()`, `LiveFactory::resolve_plan()` (the tray's "Reload
//! config"), `ksx run` and `ksx daemon` all go through. Hot-swap eligibility
//! (`SessionShape::bounce_reason`) compares `DeviceId`s to decide whether a
//! config edit is structural enough to bounce a live session. Resolve anywhere
//! downstream of that comparison and every preset edit reports "slot N's input
//! device changed" and restarts the pads mid-game.
