//! The `ksx run` supervisor: three threads, one teardown order, no tokio.
//!
//! ```text
//! [capture thread]  owned by ksx-capture. Receives strokes, evaluates the
//!                   emergency escapes (there, where nothing can starve them),
//!                   decides pass/suppress, re-sends what must pass, try_sends
//!                   KeyEvents.
//!        │ bounded crossbeam channel (1024; capture never blocks on it)
//!        ▼
//! [engine thread]   owns the ksx-core Engine. Maps events to pad deltas and
//!                   try_sends them, coalescing per slot — it never blocks.
//!        │ bounded channel of (PadDelta, capture timestamp)
//!        ▼
//! [output thread]   owns the VirtualPadBackend. Plugs the pads, applies deltas,
//!                   drains rumble/LED feedback, records the latency histogram.
//!
//! [supervisor]      this thread. Owns policy: capture on/off, teardown order,
//!                   hotplug invalidation, printing. May block freely — nothing
//!                   in the input path waits on it.
//! ```
//!
//! # The two orders that matter
//!
//! **Startup**: pads are plugged and their XInput slots resolved *first* (a
//! plug failure must not happen with keyboards already captured), then capture
//! starts in passthrough, then blocking is enabled for exactly the devices
//! bound to slots. Unassigned keyboards are never in that set.
//!
//! **Teardown**: uncapture *before* unplug, always. A [`CaptureGuard`] sends
//! `SetPassthrough` from `Drop`, so a panic anywhere in the supervisor still
//! frees the keyboards; and process death frees them with no cleanup at all
//! (the driver releases filters with the context handle). Every fatal condition
//! — Ctrl+C, thread death, capture panic, watchdog trip, output error — runs
//! the same path. The output thread never unplugs on its own initiative either:
//! a failing pad update is *reported*, and the supervisor drives teardown in
//! order (otherwise the pads vanish while the keyboards are still captured).
//!
//! # What the supervisor is NOT on the critical path for
//!
//! Emergency escapes. They are detected and acted on inside the capture thread
//! (`ksx_capture::escape`); this thread only *polls* the resulting counters to
//! mirror its own bookkeeping, print, and beep. If this thread stopped running
//! entirely, `LeftCtrl ×5` would still free the keyboards.
//!
//! # One session's worth of state, on state that outlives the session
//!
//! Everything below was written when the capture backend was born and died with
//! the session: health flags and escape counters started at zero because the
//! object holding them was new. Since M6 that is no longer true for a claimed
//! panel — the daemon claims once and keeps the claim (and its `Handles`) for
//! its whole lifetime, so a second session borrows state a first session already
//! wrote into. Latched flags would then be read as *this* session's, which turns
//! one watchdog trip into "every game after it refuses to start".
//!
//! So a session takes a **baseline** at [`supervise`]'s startup and reads
//! deltas: [`ksx_capture::HealthView`] for health, `seen_escapes` seeded from
//! the live counters for escapes. Two consequences worth stating plainly:
//!
//! - `ksx run` is bit-for-bit unaffected. It builds its own backend per run, so
//!   the baseline is all-zero and every delta is the value itself.
//! - The one piece of health that is *not* session-scoped is
//!   `reboot_required`: Interception slot exhaustion is a property of the
//!   machine until it restarts, not of a session (`ksx_capture::CaptureHealth::since`).
//!
//! The escape **latch** cannot be handled by a reader, because the capture
//! thread and the panel's typethrough act on it live. It is re-armed once, at
//! session start, by `EscapeHandle::arm` — starting a session is the user
//! asking for emulation *now*, and a gesture from a game they already quit must
//! not silently keep the panel typing onto the desktop behind the new one.
