//! `ksx setup` — the first-contact wizard: a fresh machine to a working panel
//! without hand-writing a line of TOML.
//!
//! This is Build B of `docs/MAPPER-UX.md`, pointed at a new install rather
//! than at one slot of an existing one, and it copies EmulationStation's shape
//! deliberately (`docs/research/mapping-ux-field-study.md` §Track 2 — the
//! strings were read off this cabinet's own RetroBat install):
//!
//! 1. **Identify by PRESS, never by a numbered list.** "Hold a key on the
//!    panel for player 1" — on a cabinet with two identical encoders, a list
//!    of hardware ids is not an answer anyone can give (`docs/USE-CASES.md`
//!    T4, and commandment 1: the physical press is the pointer).
//! 2. **Sequential, POSITION-NAMED prompts.** The prompt says `SOUTH`, not
//!    `A`, because the letter on a Nintendo pad is in the other place and half
//!    the arcade world's panels are labelled by position anyway. What gets
//!    STORED is our own function vocabulary (`A`, `dpad.up`, `lx.min`) — the
//!    prompt is for the human, the name is for the file (commandment 6).
//! 3. **Auto-advance on press**, with the press echoed as it lands.
//! 4. **Inline ALREADY TAKEN.** A key already used by this run is refused at
//!    the moment it is pressed, with the control that holds it named, and the
//!    prompt stays put. (Deliberate multi-binds are a `ksx map` job — inside a
//!    first-contact run a duplicate is a misfire nine times out of ten.)
//! 5. **Completeness audit before commit.** A panel with no Start and no Back
//!    cannot leave a game; ES learned this the hard way with its hotkey audit.
//! 6. **Transactional.** Nothing is written until the review screen is
//!    confirmed. DISCARD is always the default answer.
//!
//! # The one deliberate deviation: skipping
//!
//! ES skips a control by HOLDING a key for two seconds. ksx cannot: its
//! observer is `ksx_capture::observe_next_key`, a Raw Input sink that reports
//! MAKES, and it re-baselines every key that is already down when it starts
//! (`docs/research/padforge-code-audit.md` §1.2) — so a held key becomes
//! invisible rather than continuous, and the only way to see a hold would be
//! to probe autorepeat for a second after EVERY press, taxing all twenty
//! bindings to make one skip cheap.
//!
//! So skipping is the same affordance inverted: **press nothing.** Each prompt
//! runs a visible per-second countdown ([`Options::step_secs`]); when it
//! expires the control is skipped and the wizard advances. Two skips in a row
//! end the run early and skip everything left — which makes bailing out of the
//! optional tail cost ~12 s instead of ES's ~40 s of holding.
//!
//! `Escape` cancels the whole run. It is the only reserved key; a panel that
//! genuinely has Escape wired can be given it afterwards with `ksx map`.
//!
//! # Exit codes
//!
//! 0 = written, discarded, or a dry run (all three are the user's answer being
//! honoured), 1 = error, [`EXIT_REFUSED`] (2) = refused before anything was
//! written (no device identified, nothing bound, an unusable `--profile`).

// Off Windows only the stub `run` is reachable, but the whole state machine
// (and its tests) stays compiled — that is the half worth testing everywhere.
