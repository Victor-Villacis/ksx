//! The staged setup's two exits: **save it** and **play it** —
//! `docs/FIRST-RUN.md` §2, moment 7.
//!
//! [`ksx_core::StagedSetup`] is the value a visit accumulates; it has no path
//! to a file and no path to a driver. This module is the only thing that gives
//! it either, and it gives it **one translation for both**:
//!
//! ```text
//!                      ┌─ [`to_config`] ─┐
//!   CommitSpec  ───────┤                 ├──► ConfigFile
//!                      └─────────────────┘        │
//!                                 ┌───────────────┴────────────────┐
//!                        [`apply`] (save)                  [`plan`] (play)
//!                     store.backup + save_config        run::plan::build_plan
//! ```
//!
//! # Why one translation is the requirement, not a tidiness
//!
//! §2: *"What is staged is what plays. There is no second translation step
//! where a saved file means something different from what the screen showed."*
//! Two functions — one that turned a stage into a session and one that turned
//! it into TOML — would be two chances to disagree, and the disagreement would
//! surface as "it worked when I pressed Play and the pads were wrong after I
//! restarted". So both exits are built from [`to_config`], and
//! [`tests::what_is_staged_is_what_plays`] pins it by planning the in-memory
//! config and the one read back off disk and comparing the two plans.
//!
//! # Which existing writers this feeds, and which it does not duplicate
//!
//! - **The config writer is `ksx_config::Store::save_config`**, behind
//!   `Store::backup`, which is the identical six lines
//!   [`crate::device_edit::apply_pick`] uses and the pattern
//!   [`crate::slots::assign`] documents. There is no second writer here: this
//!   module composes a `ConfigFile` and hands it over.
//! - **The `[[slot]]` shape comes from `ConfigFile::slot_entry`**, ksx-config's
//!   own reverse of the `slot_spec` that `build_plan` reads. Writing
//!   `SlotEntry` by hand here would be exactly the second translation above —
//!   and the round trip is already pinned by ksx-config's
//!   `slot_spec_resolves_alias_to_instance_path`.
//! - **The planner is `crate::run::plan::build_plan`**, unchanged and pure:
//!   the same function `ksx run`, `ksx daemon`, autostart and the tray's
//!   "Reload config" all reach through `resolve_as`. Play-without-saving is
//!   that function called on a `ConfigFile` that was never written, which is
//!   why a staged session refuses for exactly the reasons a saved one would.
//! - **The preset writer is `Store::save_preset`**, the same atomic save
//!   `ksx setup` and the mapper use.
//!
//! # Nothing here claims or plugs
//!
//! [`plan`] returns a plan. Claiming a board is still `ksx winusb claim`, and
//! plugging pads is still the supervisor's job at session start — `SURFACES.md`
//! §3 and `FIRST-RUN.md` §6 both require that an action which looked like a
//! menu choice never turns out to have installed a driver or claimed a board.
