//! `ksx open`, and the tray item that is the same thing: ksx on screen as an
//! application window, or a sentence saying why not.
//!
//! docs/M9-DECISION.md cancelled the native config UI and made Studio the UI.
//! What that decision costs, and therefore what this file owes, is stated in
//! its §2: *"The thing that makes ksx feel like a web page is not HTML — it is
//! that you launch it by typing a URL, and that clicking a shortcut before the
//! daemon is up would hand you `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`. Both are launcher
//! bugs."* This is the launcher.
//!
//! # The four things it does, in order
//!
//! 1. **Make sure a daemon is running.** [`ensure_daemon`] probes the control
//!    pipe, starts `ksx daemon` — the same verb `ksx autostart` registers —
//!    and waits, bounded, for the pipe to answer. A daemon that never answers
//!    is a WARNING and not the end: Studio's read side needs no daemon
//!    (M9-DECISION §4 item 7), so the window still opens, read-only, behind
//!    its own "No daemon" banner. Refusing to open at all would delete the
//!    recovery path.
//! 2. **Make sure Studio is serving.** Probe the port, start `ksx studio` if
//!    nothing answers, and **wait for it** before handing anyone a URL. This
//!    is the `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` half, and it is the property this file
//!    had before the rest of M9 existed.
//! 3. **Resolve a browser through `App Paths`, never `ShellExecute` on a
//!    URL** (§4 item 2). `ksx_platform::app_paths` asks the registry where
//!    `msedge.exe` — then `chrome.exe` — actually is. A default-browser
//!    activation cannot be given flags, so it cannot produce the window
//!    below; and on a stripped image there may be no `http` association at
//!    all.
//! 4. **Open a chrome-less application window** — `--app=<url>` with a
//!    `--user-data-dir` **ksx owns**, under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ksx`. Its own
//!    taskbar button, its own alt-tab entry, no address bar, no tabs, and
//!    none of the user's extensions, cookies or zoom state (§2).
//!
//! # What it still does not do
//!
//! - **No single instance.** A second `ksx open` starts a second window
//!   rather than focusing the first — M9-DECISION §4 item 5, not built here.
//! - **No WebView2 host.** That is Option B, priced and held in reserve (§3);
//!   this window is a browser we drive, and its right-click menu, Ctrl+P and
//!   F12 are all still live. The triggers that would flip that decision are
//!   in §7 and none of them has fired.
//! - **No port option.** [`PORT`] is spelled once here and matches `ksx
//!   studio`'s default. A Studio deliberately served on another port is not
//!   found by this launcher, which starts one of its own on [`PORT`].
//!
//! # Where the fallback goes
//!
//! With no Chromium registered under either name, or with no directory ksx
//! can call its own, the window degrades to the default-browser
//! `shell_open` this file did before — **and says which and why**, because a
//! surface that cannot do the thing it promised must say so rather than
//! quietly do something else (docs/CONTROL-SURFACE.md).
