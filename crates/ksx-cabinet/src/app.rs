//! The window: state, the worker thread, and the chrome around the screens.
//!
//! # The threading contract, inherited verbatim
//!
//! `daemon/tray.rs` states the property this window has to keep: *it owns no
//! channel to the capture thread, the engine thread or the output thread; its
//! only outbound edge is a `Sender`; it reads state through one mutex it holds
//! for the length of a clone.* This window is the same shape, one layer out:
//!
//! ```text
//! [ui thread]      egui. Draws. Reads Arc<Mutex<Slow>> for a clone, drains a
//!                  lossy LiveFeed, and sends Asks. NEVER performs a verb.
//!        │ Sender<Ask>              ▲ Arc<Mutex<Slow>>
//!        ▼                          │
//! [cabinet worker] owns the ksx-api sources. Every verb happens here, where
//!                  blocking is free — a `start` settles for up to five
//!                  seconds, and a UI thread that waited for it would be a
//!                  frozen window on a cabinet.
//! ```
//!
//! That split is not stylistic. The pipe's action verbs poll for their outcome
//! (docs/CONTROL-SURFACE.md: "Action verbs poll the snapshot up to 5 s"), and
//! `StatusSource::snapshot` re-runs the driver collectors. Both belong off the
//! paint thread, and neither of them can reach a pipeline thread from there
//! either — `ksx-api`'s whole contract is that it has exactly the tray's reach.
