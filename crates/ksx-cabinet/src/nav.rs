//! **The navigation model: a joystick, two buttons, and nothing else.**
//!
//! The tiebreaker this whole surface was designed against — *can it be done
//! with a joystick, two buttons, no text entry, in ten seconds, by someone
//! standing at the cab with a game about to start?* — is a statement about
//! THIS module. Everything drawn elsewhere is a list of things you can already
//! do; this is the part that says what "doing" means.
//!
//! Four moves and two verbs:
//!
//! | input | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | up / down | previous / next item on this screen |
//! | left / right | previous / next SCREEN (the tab strip), or a horizontal choice inside one |
//! | confirm (A / South / Enter) | do the focused thing |
//! | back (B / East / Esc) | up one level; from the top level, nothing (never "quit") |
//!
//! Deliberately absent: no page-up, no home/end, no shoulder-button
//! accelerators, no long-press, no chord. Every one of those is a thing a
//! person has to be TOLD, and the population of this surface is "whoever is
//! standing at the cabinet", which includes the eight-year-old who just said
//! P3 does not work.
//!
//! # Pure on purpose
//!
//! Nothing here draws, reads a device, or knows what a screen contains beyond
//! how many rows it has. That is what lets the whole interaction model be
//! tested without a window — and it is the same reason `ksx setup`'s wizard is
//! a pure state machine with the observer supplied from outside.

/// One navigation input, whatever produced it — a pad, a keyboard, or a test.
