//! **Driving this window from the arcade panel — the hard requirement.**
//!
//! A cabinet has no mouse and no keyboard, so a config surface that can only
//! be driven by one is a surface nobody at the cabinet can use. There are two
//! input paths and **which one works depends on whether emulation is
//! running**, which is the finding this module exists for:
//!
//! | emulation | what the panel is | what drives this window |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | **stopped** | an ordinary keyboard (Interception), or typethrough re-injecting its keys (WinUSB) | **winit**, exactly like any desktop app — egui sees real key events |
//! | **running** | captured below win32k, and on WinUSB deliberately muted from typethrough (`daemon::control_loop_with` calls `set_emulating(true)` before the session exists) | **nothing, via winit.** The window is on a machine whose panel produces no keystrokes at all |
//!
//! That second row is not a limitation to work around; it is the whole point
//! of ksx. The panel's presses are being translated into virtual pad state,
//! and those pads are **real XInput devices on this machine** — so the way to
//! read the panel while emulation is running is to read what ksx just
//! published. `XInputGetState` against our own pads, in the same process that
//! created them.
//!
//! The consequence is worth stating plainly: **while a session is running, a
//! press does both things.** It moves this cursor and it plays the game. That
//! is why [`PadNav::poll`] is only ever called with the cabinet window
//! FOCUSED — a window nobody is looking at must not eat a fireball motion.
//!
//! # Why not gilrs
//!
//! Five constants, one struct and one function against the `windows-sys` this
//! workspace already links, versus a crate with its own event loop, its own
//! device thread and its own opinion about hotplug. `daemon/tray.rs` made the
//! same call for the same reason, and wrote down the same rationale.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! `XInputGetState` on a CONNECTED pad is a cheap user-mode call. On an absent
//! user index it is documented to be slow (it goes looking), so absent indices
//! are probed at most every [`PROBE_ABSENT`] rather than every frame — the
//! difference between a 60 Hz UI and a 60 Hz UI that stutters on a cabinet
//! with two players plugged in.
