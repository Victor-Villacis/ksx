//! **Read-only** Bluetooth enumeration: the `BTHENUM\` half of "what input
//! devices are attached", beside [`crate::winusb::enumerate`]'s USB half.
//!
//! # Why a second pass exists at all
//!
//! `nusb` enumerates the USB tree, and a Bluetooth device is not on it. Until
//! this module existed `ksx device scan` walked USB and therefore could not see
//! a Bluetooth keyboard AT ALL, while `ksx devices` walked the Interception
//! keyboard stack and saw it with no grouping and no word about which backends
//! could capture it. Two incomplete lists, and a user with a Bluetooth keyboard
//! reading the more detailed of the two was told, in effect, that their
//! keyboard did not exist.
//!
//! # The safety property, identical to the USB pass
//!
//! Nothing here opens, claims, configures or resets a device. It is one
//! `CM_Get_Device_ID_ListW(FILTER_PRESENT)` walk plus `KEY_READ` registry
//! reads, performed by [`ksx_platform::winusb::present_nodes`] — the *same*
//! walk `ksx winusb status` does. One tree read, two consumers, so a device
//! list can never disagree with the refusal that guards a claim.
//!
//! # What a Bluetooth row can and cannot do (`ksx_core::transport`)
//!
//! A Bluetooth keyboard **can** be captured by Interception: it is a
//! keyboard-class devnode on the Windows input stack exactly like a USB one.
//! It can **never** be WinUSB-claimed: a claim is an INF binding a USB
//! interface by hardware id, and there is no USB interface here to bind. This
//! module does not decide that — it reports the transport, and
//! [`ksx_core::Reach::eligibility`] decides. See that module for why the
//! distinction is worded as the transport rather than as "unsupported".
//!
//! # The trap this pass must not fall into
//!
//! **A paired-but-disconnected Bluetooth keyboard reads PRESENT all day.**
//! Pairing is what puts the node in the tree; the batteries have nothing to do
//! with it. So every candidate carries [`BtCandidate::can_type`], sourced from
//! `CM_Get_DevNode_Status` (`CM_PROB_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED`), and the row stays
//! listed — hiding it would be its own lie — under a verdict that says it
//! cannot deliver a keystroke. `ksx_platform::winusb::Survey::keyboard_count`
//! already excludes it from the last-keyboard arithmetic, which is the refusal
//! standing between a user and a panel they cannot type on.
