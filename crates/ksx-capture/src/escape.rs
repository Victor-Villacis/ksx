//! Emergency escapes, evaluated **on the capture thread** — the only place they
//! cannot be starved.
//!
//! # Why this lives here and not in the app layer
//!
//! M4 originally ran [`ksx_core::EscapeDetector`] on the engine thread, one
//! bounded channel downstream of capture and one *blocking* send upstream of
//! output. That is a lockout: if the output thread wedges (a ViGEm IOCTL that
//! never returns), the engine blocks on its send, stops draining key events, and
//! the escape gesture is never evaluated — with every cabinet keyboard captured
//! and no second keyboard to rescue from. This module therefore evaluates the
//! gesture inside the interception callback, before the blocking decision.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! - Every stroke is fed to [`EscapeWatch::observe`] **before** the pass/suppress
//!   decision, so the stroke that completes a gesture is already un-suppressed.
//! - On `LeftCtrl ×5` the capture thread flips its **own** passthrough latch —
//!   no channel, no supervisor round trip, no possible starvation. The gesture
//!   works even when the event channel is full and every consumer is wedged.
//! - `Ctrl+Alt+Del` forces the latch on (never off) and raises a stop request.
//! - The supervisor learns about all of it by polling [`EscapeHandle`] — the
//!   same shape as [`crate::HealthHandle`]: atomics, lock-free, cloned before
//!   `run` consumes the backend, valid for the life of the process.
//!
//! The latch is one-way per gesture and is **or**-ed into the ctl-driven
//! passthrough flag, so a supervisor that keeps sending `SetCaptured` (hotplug,
//! a stale mirror of its own state) can never re-arm blocking behind an escape's
//! back. Re-enabling capture takes a second `LeftCtrl ×5` — releasing keyboards
//! is instant, re-capturing them is deliberate.
