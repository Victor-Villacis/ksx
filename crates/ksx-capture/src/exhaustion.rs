//! Interception 10-keyboard-slot exhaustion detector.
//!
//! Every unplug/replug or hibernate/resume cycle *increments* a device's
//! Interception slot number; past 10 the keyboard silently ceases to function
//! until reboot ("nothing I can do" — evilC). KSX detects the climb and
//! surfaces **reboot required** loudly.
//!
//! # Why the API is pass-oriented
//!
//! A climb is a statement about *time*: the same board occupies a higher slot
//! than it did before. Two identical boards occupying slots 1 and 2 is not a
//! climb, it is Tuesday — but a detector that compares observations pairwise
//! sees the ascending walk of one rescan (`1: X`, then `2: X`) as X climbing
//! from 1 to 2 and screams REBOOT REQUIRED at a perfectly healthy cabinet.
//!
//! So observations are grouped into **passes**: [`ExhaustionDetector::begin_pass`],
//! one [`ExhaustionDetector::observe_keyboard`] per slot, then
//! [`ExhaustionDetector::end_pass`], which is the only thing that can report a
//! climb — and only by comparing this pass's highest slot per hardware id
//! against the previous pass's. Within a pass, duplicates are just duplicates.
//! [`ExhaustionDetector::observe_hotplug`] is the single-observation form for
//! the hot path (a stroke arriving on a slot we had not seen).
//!
//! Pure (fed observed slot numbers + hardware ids) so the policy is
//! unit-testable with mock device numbers.
