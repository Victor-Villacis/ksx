//! Lock-free health flags a capture thread publishes and the app/CLI reads.
//!
//! The handle is grabbed from the backend *before* `run` consumes it and stays
//! valid for the life of the process — atomics only, so the capture hot path
//! can set flags without locks.
//!
//! # Latches, and why a reader needs a baseline
//!
//! Every flag here is **write-only**: a backend sets it, nothing ever clears it.
//! That is right for the state it describes (a stall that happened, happened)
//! and it was harmless while a [`HealthHandle`] lived exactly as long as one
//! session — the M3–M5 shape, where `supervise()` built the backend, read its
//! flags, and dropped it.
//!
//! M6 broke that assumption. The daemon claims its WinUSB panel **once**, for
//! its whole lifetime, so the health state behind it now outlives every session
//! that borrows it ([`crate::backend::Handles`], `ksx-backend`'s `daemon::panel`).
//! A reader that treats these latches as "what happened to me" therefore reads
//! somebody else's history: one watchdog trip in the first game would end every
//! later game before it translated a keystroke, blaming a stall that was already
//! over.
//!
//! [`HealthView`] is the fix, and it is a *reader*-side one — the flags stay
//! exactly as latched and as cheap as they were, and the panel keeps its one
//! shared health state. A session takes a baseline at its start and reports
//! [`CaptureHealth::since`] it. See that method for which values are
//! session-scoped and which are cumulative on purpose.
