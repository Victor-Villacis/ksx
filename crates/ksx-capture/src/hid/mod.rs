//! HID plumbing for the WinUSB backend: report-descriptor parsing, report
//! decoding, and the usage → canonical KSX key-vocabulary bridge.
//!
//! Platform-free and OS-free on purpose — this is the part of M6 that is fully
//! CI-testable, and it is tested against **synthetic** report bytes assembled
//! from the HID 1.11 spec ([`fixtures`]), never against the cabinet's live
//! I-PAC. See [`report`] for the rollover rule and [`usage`] for why the
//! translation goes through set-1 scancodes instead of straight to
//! [`ksx_core::Key`].
