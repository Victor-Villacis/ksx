//! `InterceptionBackend` — per-device keyboard capture via the Interception
//! driver (day-one default, scheduled for retirement at M6; see
//! `docs/research/keyboard-capture-2026.md` §1/§7).
//!
//! # Why `kanata_interception::raw` instead of the safe wrapper
//!
//! Verified against the crate source in the registry cache
//! (`kanata-interception-0.3.0/src/lib.rs`):
//!
//! 1. **The safe `KeyState` bitflags define `E1 = 3`; the driver header and
//!    `interception-sys` say `E1 = 0x04`.** A real E1 stroke
//!    (the Pause make, state `0x04`/`0x05`) fails `KeyState::from_bits` and the
//!    safe `receive()` *silently discards it* — the stroke is consumed from the
//!    driver but never re-sent, so the Pause key would die for every keyboard
//!    on the system while we run. Unacceptable.
//! 2. The safe `receive`/`send` allocate a `Vec` per call — the hot path must
//!    not allocate after startup.
//! 3. The safe `ScanCode` conversion maps unknown codes to `Esc`, corrupting a
//!    re-sent stroke. Re-sends must be byte-for-byte what the driver gave us.
//!
//! The raw FFI (`interception-sys 0.1.3`, re-exported as
//! `kanata_interception::raw`) has the correct constants and lets us keep the
//! `InterceptionKeyStroke` untouched from receive to send.
//!
//! # Threading and safety model
//!
//! `run` owns the only thread that ever touches the context after start. The
//! hot loop does exactly: wait (with timeout so ctl is honored), receive,
//! evaluate emergency escapes (`crate::escape` — before any pass/suppress
//! decision, so `LeftCtrl ×5` frees the keyboards from *this* thread with no
//! channel in the way), decide from an `arc-swap` snapshot, re-send
//! non-captured strokes verbatim, `try_send` the event (never block). No locks,
//! no allocation after startup
//! except (a) the one-time `SlotEntry` build when a *new* device appears
//! (hotplug — rare by definition) and (b) the `DeviceId` clone each reported
//! `KeyEvent` requires by ksx-core contract (small, amortized; noted in the M3
//! summary as a candidate for `Arc<str>` in M4).
//!
//! Crash safety: [`Ctx`]'s `Drop` is the guard — it sets both class filters to
//! `NONE` **before** destroying the context, and it runs on panic unwind, on
//! normal return, and if the backend is dropped without ever running. Process
//! death needs no cleanup at all (the driver releases filters when the handle
//! closes); the guard exists for the deadly middle case — a dead capture
//! thread inside a living process; the watchdog below covers that second case.
//!
//! Thread priority is set inline with `windows-sys` rather than through
//! `ksx-platform`: one syscall does not justify an inter-crate dependency from
//! the capture hot path (deliberate design decision, see M3 notes).
//!
//! # Where the DLL comes from
//!
//! Every `interception_*` call below goes through [`crate::interception_dll`]'s
//! `GetProcAddress` table, never through `interception-sys`'s import stubs. That
//! is not a style choice: a static import makes `interception.dll` a **load-time
//! requirement of `ksx.exe` itself**, so `ksx --version` on a WinUSB-only
//! cabinet dies in the Windows loader before `main`. Only `Api` (loaded when
//! this backend is *constructed*) is allowed to need the DLL. The types are
//! still `kanata_interception::raw`'s — a `#[repr(C)]` declaration creates no
//! linkage, and a second hand-written `InterceptionKeyStroke` would be a second
//! source of truth for the layout the hot path re-sends byte-for-byte.
