//! ksx-capture — per-device keyboard capture + OS-input blocking.
//!
//! Three backends behind one trait (see `docs/research/keyboard-capture-2026.md`):
//! - `interception` (M3, day-1 default): via `kanata-interception`'s raw FFI
//!   layer (the safe wrapper mis-defines E1 and allocates on the hot path —
//!   see `src/interception.rs`); ships with a 10-slot ID-drift exhaustion
//!   detector surfacing "reboot required" loudly.
//! - `winusb` (M6, strategic primary): claims the I-PAC's `MI_00` interface via
//!   in-box winusb.sys + `nusb` — blocking and identity become structural.
//! - `rawinput` (M3): identify-only device picker; NEVER a blocking backend
//!   (the RawInput+LLHOOK correlation hack is rejected by design).
//!
//! …and one that reads no hardware at all: [`replay`] plays a recorded session
//! (`ksx monitor --record`) back through the same trait, so a file drives the
//! identical pipeline a person does.
//!
//! Hot-path rule: the capture thread only receives, evaluates emergency escapes
//! ([`escape`]), decides pass/suppress from an arc-swap snapshot, re-sends what
//! must pass (byte-for-byte), and pushes into a bounded channel with `try_send`
//! (drops counted, never blocks). Zero locks; zero allocation after startup
//! except the per-event `DeviceId` clone the ksx-core `KeyEvent` contract
//! requires and cold-path hotplug bookkeeping.
//!
//! Escapes are evaluated **here**, before the pass/suppress decision, and act on
//! this thread's own passthrough latch — never through a channel. That is the
//! one property that makes them unstarvable: a wedged consumer downstream
//! (engine, output, driver IOCTL) cannot stop `LeftCtrl ×5` from freeing the
//! keyboards.
//!
//! Safety posture (this machine's keyboards are production hardware):
//! - Backends start in **passthrough** (observe-only); nothing is suppressed
//!   until `CaptureCtl::SetCaptured` arrives.
//! - Crash-only: process death needs no cleanup (driver releases filters with
//!   the context handle); a panicking thread in a living process is covered by
//!   a Drop guard that sets filters to NONE before destroying the context.
//! - A watchdog force-flips to passthrough if the event consumer stalls
//!   > 500 ms, so keystrokes reach the OS instead of a black hole.
//! - The mouse filter is never set in M3 — mouse.sys is never touched.
