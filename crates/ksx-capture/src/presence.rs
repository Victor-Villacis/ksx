//! Live device-presence publication from a *running* capture backend.
//!
//! Hotplug detection needs to answer one question while emulation runs: is the
//! device bound to slot N still there? Only the capture backend can answer it —
//! it is the thing holding the driver context. `devices()` is a `&mut self`
//! cold-path enumeration that happens before [`crate::CaptureBackend::run`]
//! consumes the backend, so the supervisor needs a handle that stays live
//! afterwards. This is that handle, shaped exactly like
//! [`crate::health::HealthHandle`]: cloneable, lock-free, grabbed before `run`.
//!
//! Publication is a **cold path**: the Interception backend republishes only
//! when the driver reports itself idle (no strokes pending), at most every few
//! seconds. It allocates; that is fine there and nowhere else.
//!
//! `snapshot()` returns `None` until the backend has published at least once,
//! so a supervisor can distinguish "no devices" from "not known yet" and never
//! invalidates a slot on a startup race.
