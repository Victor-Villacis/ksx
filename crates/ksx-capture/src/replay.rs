//! `ReplayBackend` — a recorded session as a capture source.
//!
//! The third [`CaptureBackend`], beside Interception and WinUSB: instead of
//! reading a driver it reads a file `ksx monitor --record` wrote, and emits the
//! events it holds on the schedule they were recorded at. Everything downstream
//! is untouched — same engine, same presets, same personas, same pads — because
//! the only thing that changed is where the [`KeyEvent`]s came from. That is
//! the whole point: a recording drives the identical pipeline a human does, so
//! replaying one is both an attract-mode demo and a full-stack regression test
//! that needs no hardware.
//!
//! # One format, and it already exists
//!
//! The corpus is the JSONL `ksx monitor --record` writes (documented in
//! `ksx-backend/src/monitor.rs`), one object per line:
//!
//! ```json
//! {"t_ms": 1042, "device": "HID\\VID_D209&PID_0430&REV_0001&MI_00", "key": "A", "down": true}
//! ```
//!
//! A **macro** is a trigger-fired sequence bound to a key
//! (`docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md` §1c); a **session** is a whole timeline with no
//! trigger at all. They are different things, so a session is not stored as a
//! macro — and a second file format for the same four fields would be a second
//! thing to keep true. Parsing is hand-rolled here because this crate is
//! deliberately serde-free and because the format is a *stable contract*, not a
//! derived type.
//!
//! # Escapes are deliberately NOT evaluated on a replayed stroke
//!
//! [`CaptureBackend::escapes`] is undefaulted precisely so a new backend has to
//! say what it does about the emergency hatch. This one **never observes its own
//! events**: on an I-PAC, P1 Button 1 *is* LeftCtrl, so a recorded four-player
//! session is full of `LeftCtrl ×5` gestures that were never a gesture — they
//! were somebody playing. Feeding them to [`crate::escape::EscapeWatch`] would
//! make an attract loop free the keyboards and stop itself, at a moment nobody
//! asked for anything. The hatch is a thing a *person* does, so it stays with
//! the backend that watches the real board ([`Silenced`], which is exactly why
//! playback keeps one).
//!
//! # The clock is injected
//!
//! [`ReplayClock`] has one method — wait until this event's stamp — so the
//! schedule can be driven by [`VirtualClock`] in a test and asserted directly,
//! with no sleeping and no wall-clock flake.
