//! `WinUsbBackend` — the capture path that outlives the 2026 signing cliff.
//!
//! One instance owns **one claimed USB interface** (the I-PAC's `MI_00`).
//! Several boards means several instances, composed by
//! [`crate::CompositeBackend`]; that keeps this type honest — a single device,
//! a single endpoint, a single blocking read — instead of a hand-rolled
//! multiplexer inside the hot loop.
//!
//! # Why this backend exists
//!
//! `oblitum/Interception`'s `keyboard.sys` is cross-signed with a certificate
//! that expired in 2012. This machine already runs Microsoft's
//! cross-signed-driver audit CI policy (`{784C4414-…}`, live 2026-08-03); when
//! it flips to enforcement the driver stops loading and every Interception
//! capture path dies at boot. Binding the interface to Microsoft's in-box
//! `winusb.sys` instead removes the third-party kernel driver from the picture
//! entirely (`docs/research/keyboard-capture-2026.md` §4, §7).
//!
//! # Blocking is structural — and that inverts everything
//!
//! Once the interface is bound to `winusb.sys`, it has left the `kbdclass`
//! stack. Windows does not see the board. Not "ksx suppresses its keystrokes" —
//! there is no keyboard there to suppress. That is the property this milestone
//! is bought with, and it is also the property that makes this backend behave
//! differently from every other one:
//!
//! | | `InterceptionBackend` | `WinUsbBackend` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | default state of a device | typing into Windows | invisible to Windows |
//! | `SetCaptured([id])` | start suppressing `id` | stop **injecting** `id` |
//! | `SetPassthrough` | stop suppressing | start injecting everything |
//! | escape latch / watchdog | releases the filter | starts injecting |
//! | ksx crashes | keyboard works again in <1 s | keyboard stays dark |
//! | a bug leaks | a keystroke reaches Windows | a keystroke vanishes |
//!
//! So `SetCaptured`/`SetPassthrough` keep their *meaning* — "is this device's
//! input allowed to reach Windows" — and change their *mechanism*: passthrough
//! is synthesis via [`ksx_platform::inject::KeyInjector`], not a re-send. The shared
//! [`crate::decision::should_resend`] predicate still decides, unchanged, so
//! there is exactly one place in the codebase that answers the question.
//!
//! The last row of that table is the one to internalise: **crash-only recovery
//! does not apply to the blocking**. Killing ksx frees an Interception-captured
//! keyboard; it does not un-bind a WinUSB interface. What crash-only still buys
//! is that nothing is left half-pressed — the drop guard releases every key it
//! injected. Restoring the board to a keyboard is `pnputil` (`docs/RECOVERY.md`
//! §2), and the reason `docs/RECOVERY.md` insists on one never-claimed spare
//! keyboard on a different port.
//!
//! # Identity
//!
//! [`crate::backend::DeviceInfo::id`] is the interface's **device instance
//! path** — `USB\VID_D209&PID_0430&MI_00\7&1A2B3C4D&0&0000` — not a hardware
//! id. Two identical encoders on different ports get different paths, which is
//! the structural fix for T4 (`docs/USE-CASES.md`). Migration from an
//! Interception-hwid config is documented in `docs/MIGRATION-WINUSB.md`; `ksx devices`
//! prints the replacement line to paste.
//!
//! # Hot path
//!
//! Per report: one `wait_next_complete`, a decode into a stack [`crate::hid::UsageSet`],
//! an XOR diff, and per changed key an escape check, a `should_resend`, maybe
//! one `SendInput`, and one `try_send`. The transfer buffer is allocated once
//! and resubmitted forever. No locks, no logging, no allocation after startup
//! beyond the per-event `DeviceId` clone the `KeyEvent` contract requires.
