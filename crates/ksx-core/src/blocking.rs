//! How much of a bound keyboard a session takes away from Windows — the
//! setting `block_keyboards` names.
//!
//! The vocabulary lives here, next to [`crate::Socd`] and
//! [`crate::MacroSwitch`], for the same reason those do: ksx-core carries no
//! serde, so a hand-edited config file and a running session agree on the words
//! without the engine crate learning about file formats. The TOML/JSON shape is
//! `ksx_config::blocking_serde`.

/// What ksx does with strokes from a keyboard that is bound to a slot.
///
/// # Why this is not a bool
///
/// It used to be, and the bool could only describe two of the three things
/// people actually want:
///
/// - a cabinet encoder exists to drive pads. Letting its *unmapped* buttons
///   reach Windows sprays junk into whatever has focus, so ksx takes the whole
///   device — [`Blocking::Whole`], and the default, because that is what every
///   config written so far means;
/// - a desk keyboard split into two pads still has to type. Its owner needs
///   Enter, Escape and the letters for as long as the session runs, and until
///   [`Blocking::BoundKeys`] existed they lost all of them;
/// - and [`Blocking::Off`] is "drive the pads, block nothing", which the bool
///   already spelled `false`.
///
/// The wire form keeps the bool spellings for the two states that had one
/// (`true`/`false`), so every existing config round-trips byte for byte and
/// keeps its meaning; the third state is the string `"bound-keys"`.
