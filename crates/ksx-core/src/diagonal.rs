//! Diagonals as PRESENTATION — the lens, not a new binding shape.
//!
//! Design insight from the reported failure: *"if down and
//! right together equals diagonal, the user does not care — we can present the
//! diagonal in the piano and the user can select it, and behind the scenes we
//! do down and right, so it's seamless."*
//!
//! A diagonal IS two simultaneous holds. That is ksx's implementation detail —
//! it is not the user's concept. Fighting-game players think in ↘ /
//! down-forward / numpad 3, never in "two axis bindings held together", and no
//! mapper in the field lets them pick one: Steam Input's D-pad is four cardinal
//! binding slots, reWASD's own answer is "build a Shortcut out of two zones",
//! MAME's input map is four cardinals, GP2040-CE treats diagonals purely as
//! cardinal pairs. ksx's storage model is the same model the whole field uses;
//! what is missing is the lens.
//!
//! **So this module changes nothing that is stored.** A [`crate::MacroStep`]
//! still holds a set of ordinary [`Binding`]s, files stay hand-editable, the
//! engine is untouched, and old presets keep working. [`fold`] READS a hold and
//! reports how to PRESENT it; [`expand`] puts the strings back, byte for byte.
//!
//! Nothing in the engine calls anything here — `EngineTables::build` and the hot
//! path never see it, so `macros.rs`'s "nothing allocates after build" promise
//! is unaffected.
//!
//! # The one rule
//!
//! Per mechanism bucket, **"contains both"** — never exact-set-equality on the
//! whole step. `down + forward + A` is the most common macro step in existence
//! (the attack that ends a motion) and it must fold; exact-pair matching fails
//! it. `down + forward + up` is contradictory and must NEVER fold: which
//! diagonal would it be, and what the pad publishes depends on the slot's
//! `socd` policy resolved at plan time, which a reader of the step cannot see.
