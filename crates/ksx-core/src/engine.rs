///   (an I-PAC4) legitimately drives up to 4 pads with disjoint presets.
/// - **All-keys-up**: a function releases only when *every* key mapped to it in
///   that slot's preset is up on the event's device. Aggregation is by
///   `Binding` equality, consistently across every output category.
/// - **Opposite-axis snap**: releasing a key bound to axis value `v` while a
///   key bound to the same axis with an opposite-sign value is still held snaps
///   the axis to the *held binding's own value* — not hardcoded ±32767. This is
///   KSX's native custom-axis rule; document any test that depends on it.
/// - **Chords with consumption** (docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §1b): a
///   [`Chord`] applies only while its guard holds, and while it applies its
///   constituents are SUPPRESSED — their unguarded entries stop driving
///   anything, so the game sees the chord's output instead of the parts.
///   Activation and the releases it forces land in the SAME delta batch (no
///   stranded buttons); on release, constituents still down resume their
///   individual bindings in that same batch. A larger guard beats a smaller
///   one where they overlap; equal specificity is a config error, not a race.

///   flashes its own output between the first and the second keypress. Chord
///   keys with no individual binding are free and instant, and validation
///   warns when they are not.
/// - **State diffing**: a `PadDelta` is emitted only when a slot's `PadState`
///   genuinely changed versus the last emitted state, so only real transitions
///   hit the driver.
