//! ksx-core — the pure translation engine.
//!
//! `(DeviceId, KeyEvent)` streams in, `PadState` deltas come out. This crate is
//! deliberately free of Windows dependencies, I/O, threads, and allocation on the
//! hot path so the entire mapping semantics are testable in CI (proptest lives here).
//!
//! Engine contracts KSX preserves across releases:
//! - one keyboard → many slots fan-out (the I-PAC4 case)
//! - all-keys-up release rule incl. cross-category custom-function aggregation
//! - one resolver over an endpoint's holders: digital is their OR; an analog
//!   axis takes the sign of the most recent rising demand and the largest
//!   magnitude held at that sign (zero is a sign of its own: `lx.0` demands
//!   centre), and centres when nothing holds it
//!   (`docs/UNIVERSAL-IO.md` §2 — this subsumes the older opposite-axis snap,
//!   which centred an axis whose remaining holders were all same-sign)
//! - state-diff before submit (only genuine transitions leave the engine)
//!
//! Module map:
//! - [`key`] — the single canonical key vocabulary (stable names and values)
//! - [`pad`] — XInput wire-shape [`PadState`] + stable controller ID tables
//! - [`device`] — [`DeviceId`] (instance-path identity) and [`KeyEvent`]
//! - [`selector`] — [`DeviceSelector`]: what a `[[device]] id` MEANS, so a
//!   board keeps working after it is replugged into a different USB socket
//!   (`docs/DEVICE-IDENTITY.md`)
//! - [`preset`] — [`Binding`], [`Chord`] (guarded bindings), [`Preset`], and
//!   the `default`/`empty` built-ins
//! - [`control`] — [`PadControl`]: the ENDPOINT a [`Binding`] drives, with the
//!   axis value collapsed out, so the engine can ask "who else drives this?"
//! - [`macros`] — [`Macro`]: timed sequences, the sampling floor, and the
//!   interruption policies; the scheduler that runs them lives in [`engine`]
//! - [`slot`] — [`SlotSpec`] and the 13-variant [`InvalidationReason`] taxonomy
//! - [`socd`] — [`Socd`]: SOCD cleaning, generated as chords rather than as a
//!   new engine rule; also [`socd::pointing`], the ONE definition of "where
//!   does this binding point" that opposition and diagonals are both built on
//! - [`diagonal`] — [`Diag`]: diagonals as a PRESENTATION over the stored pair.
//!   Nothing in the engine calls it; the stored model is unchanged
//! - [`templates`] — in-box preset [`Template`]s for standard panels: the
//!   zero-mapping out-of-box experience (`docs/MAPPER-UX.md` commandment 9)
//! - [`persona`] — [`Persona`]: which controller a slot presents itself as
//! - [`blocking`] — [`Blocking`]: how much of a bound keyboard a session takes
//!   away from Windows (whole device / bound keys only / nothing)
//! - [`stage`] — [`StagedSetup`]: a setup the user is still deciding on, held
//!   in memory and never written, so exploring costs nothing
//!   (`docs/FIRST-RUN.md` §2)
//! - [`engine`] — the [`Engine`]: precompiled dispatch, per-device key state, diffing
//! - [`escape`] — [`EscapeDetector`], emergency-escape detection (policy lives upstream)
