//! Which *kind* of controller a slot presents itself as.
//!
//! A persona changes only the shape of the device Windows sees. It does not
//! change capture, presets, or bindings: the wire vocabulary stays Xbox-flavored
//! everywhere (`A`, `B`, `LeftBumper`), and ✕○△□ are display aliases, not a
//! second binding language. Re-persona-ing a slot must never require editing its
//! preset — the one documented exception is the D-pad, see [`Persona::dpad_is_hat`].
//!
//! Why it exists (measured, `docs/research/m6.5-ds4-findings.md`):
//! - **Correct prompts.** A PS1/PS2/PS3 emulator reading a PlayStation pad shows
//!   ✕ instead of A. That is the whole point for a cabinet profile.
//! - **Players 5+.** Windows exposes exactly four XInput slots and no virtual bus
//!   can create a fifth. PlayStation targets are plain HID, so they neither
//!   consume nor compete for those four — six were enumerated on the cabinet
//!   while four X360 pads already held every slot.
