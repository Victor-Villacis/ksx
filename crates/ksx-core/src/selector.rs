//! [`DeviceSelector`] — what a `[[device]] id` MEANS, as opposed to what one
//! particular devnode happened to be called last Tuesday.
//!
//! # The defect this exists to remove
//!
//! A `[[device]]` entry used to hold a raw Windows device instance path:
//!
//! ```text
//! id = 'USB\VID_D209&PID_0430&MI_00\7&1A2B3C4D&0&0000'
//! ```
//!
//! Everything after the last `\` is the instance id Windows generated for that
//! board, plus the interface number. **When the board reports no USB serial**
//! that instance id follows the physical socket, so moving the board one port
//! over changes the string — and nothing errors and nothing warns: the config
//! names a devnode that does not exist, the plan finds no candidate, and the
//! panel is dead.
//!
//! Measured on the cabinet 2026-08-07, because an earlier draft of this
//! paragraph asserted it flatly: a board that *does* report a serial is keyed
//! off the serial, and the I-PAC 4X's devnode survived a root-port move
//! byte-for-byte. ksx cannot tell which kind it is holding once the board is
//! absent — a serial lives in the descriptor of a device that is not there — so
//! nothing in this crate asserts that a board moved (`docs/DEVICE-IDENTITY.md`
//! §1, §3).
//!
//! Identity whose stability depends on a descriptor field the user has never
//! seen is not identity. It is a cache key.
//!
//! # What replaces it
//!
//! A selector says *which board*, in the weakest terms that are still unique
//! (`docs/DEVICE-IDENTITY.md`). Three rungs, strongest-surviving first:
//!
//! | rung | spelling | survives a replug | tells twins apart |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | serial | `usb:d209:0430:00:sn=4` | yes | only if the firmware serials differ |
//! | model | `usb:d209:0430:00` | yes | **no** — refuses while twins are present |
//! | port | `usb:d209:0430:00:port=7&1A2B3C4D&0&0000` | no | yes, always |
//!
//! Two identical boards MUST stay tellable apart — that is the whole reason M6
//! beats Interception, and this module does not regress it: a selector that
//! matches more than one connected interface never silently picks one. It
//! reports [`Match::Ambiguous`] with every candidate, and the caller refuses.
//!
//! # On this hardware, honestly
//!
//! The I-PAC 4X *does* report a `iSerialNumber` string — and it is `"4"`. The
//! Ultimarc trackball next to it reports `"6"`. Those are one-character
//! constants that look like model or board indices, not per-unit serials, so
//! **two I-PAC 4X boards very probably both answer `"4"`**. A serial is
//! therefore treated as a *hint that is verified at match time*, never as a
//! promise: [`DeviceSelector::match_against`] compares it against every
//! connected interface and, if two answer, says so rather than guessing.
//!
//! The honest fallback when the serials do collide is the port rung, and the
//! selection flow writes it automatically in exactly that case — with the
//! trade stated out loud, because a port-pinned board is one that stops
//! working when it is moved and the user has to know which of their boards
//! that applies to.
//!
//! # Legacy spellings still resolve
//!
//! A raw instance path and an Interception hardware id are both still valid
//! `id` values ([`DeviceSelector::InstancePath`] and
//! [`DeviceSelector::HardwareId`]). Every config that works today keeps
//! working; what changes is that a *newly written* entry uses the strongest
//! surviving rung, and that `ksx device scan` prints the upgrade.
//!
//! # What a config stores, and what resolves it
//!
//! [`DeviceRef`] is the pair a `[[device]] id` holds: the selector, and the
//! text it was written as. Both, because `parse` canonicalises — see that
//! type's docs. `ksx-backend::run::resolve` turns each one into a concrete devnode
//! exactly once, at session start.
