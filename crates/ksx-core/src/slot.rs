/// Was then 8, on the guess that an 8-player panel is the largest anyone
/// builds. The guess was the only thing holding the number down — nothing in
/// the pipeline degrades past it. Every slot-keyed structure is a `Vec` or a
/// `SmallVec` that spills to the heap rather than truncating, and the one hard
/// limit is the `u8` a slot index is carried in and indexed by
/// (`engine.rs::handle_at`), which stops at 255. Meanwhile four I-PAC4 boards
/// on one cabinet is sixteen players, and the guess was refusing them.
///
/// 16 is therefore a headroom number, not a hardware one: high enough to stop
/// being the thing that says no, low enough that a per-slot array is still
/// nothing. Raise it again freely — but only with the derived limits in
/// mind, because they do not all track it automatically:
/// `ksx-app`'s clap ranges and `ksx-api`'s refusal wording read this constant
/// (both have tests that pin that), while the engine's `SmallVec` inline
/// capacities size themselves off it for speed only.

/// with an actionable message instead of producing a silently dead pad.
