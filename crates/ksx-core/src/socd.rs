//! SOCD cleaning — *Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions*
//! (docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §2.6).
//!
//! A stick can only be left OR right. A panel can hold both at once, and what
//! the pad should then report is a policy, not a fact — tournaments legislate
//! it (Capcom-style rules regulate simultaneous opposing input; *neutral* and
//! *up-priority* are the compliant answers).
//!
//! **ksx does not implement this as a new engine rule.** The design insight is
//! that chord-with-consumption (§1b) *is* the SOCD mechanism, and it already
//! shipped:
//!
//! - `[Left+Right] → `[`Binding::Consume`] — both keys suppressed, nothing
//!   emitted in their place, so the axis snaps to centre and the dpad bits
//!   clear. That is **neutral**, for free.
//! - `[Down+Up] → whatever UP drove` — both keys suppressed and the UP key's
//!   own output re-emitted by the chord, so Down is swallowed and Up survives.
//!   That is **up-priority**, the fighting-game standard, and it is one
//!   ordinary chord.
//!
//! So all this module does is GENERATE those chords from a per-slot
//! [`Socd`] setting. Everything downstream — consumption, the all-keys-up
//! rule, the one-batch release discipline, the zero-allocation hot path —
//! is the chord engine, unchanged.
//!
//! **Not implemented: last-wins / "snap tap".** It needs to know which
//! direction was pressed *most recently*, which is input history; the engine
//! is deliberately a pure function of the current key SET. It waits for the
//! transform stage (§3), not for a new binding shape.
