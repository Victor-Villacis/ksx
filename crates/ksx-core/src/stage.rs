//! The STAGED SETUP — a setup the user is still deciding on
//! (`docs/FIRST-RUN.md` §2).
//!
//! # Why this is a type and not a UI trick
//!
//! Before this module, choosing a persona *was* a `[[slot]]` written to
//! `config.toml`, and a pad appeared when a session started. "Pick PS4, look at
//! it, change to Xbox 360" was three file writes and two timestamped backups —
//! for a decision the user had not made yet. Deleting the controller they never
//! wanted left a fourth write and a backup behind it.
//!
//! A staged setup is its own value and **never touches disk**. It holds the
//! chosen device, the chosen persona per slot, the bindings so far, and the
//! blocking answer. It lives in the daemon for the length of a visit. Nothing
//! is claimed, nothing is plugged, no config file is written, until the user
//! says so — and even then, [`StagedSetup::commit`] (save) and the play path
//! are separate acts.
//!
//! The consequences §2 makes requirements, and where each one is:
//!
//! - deleting a staged controller is free and complete — [`StagedSetup::remove_slot`];
//! - "Start over" always works — [`StagedSetup::discard`], which cannot refuse;
//! - leaving without saving loses only what was typed — nothing here writes;
//! - **what is staged is what plays** — [`StagedSetup::commit`] produces ONE
//!   [`CommitSpec`], and the save path and the play path are both built from
//!   that one value. There is no second translation in which a saved file could
//!   mean something different from what the screen showed. `ksx-backend`'s
//!   `crate::stage` pins that with a test.
//!
//! # Validation is reused, never restated
//!
//! Every rule here already existed somewhere and is *read*, not re-derived:
//!
//! - [`Persona::can_plug`] gates each HIDMaestro persona independently, and the refusal
//!   quotes [`crate::Persona::gap`] verbatim — the same sentence
//!   `ksx slot assign` prints, so each exact persona stops refusing only when
//!   its production host path is proven;
//! - [`MAX_XINPUT_SLOTS`] caps the personas that occupy one of Windows' four
//!   XInput slots, counted through [`Persona::is_xinput`] — which is why
//!   `playstation` is plain HID, takes none, and is how players 5+ exist;
//! - [`MAX_SLOTS`] caps the total, through [`SlotSpec::new`]'s own check.
//!
//! Refusals name what would make the choice legal. A refusal with no way
//! forward is just an error message.
//!
//! # The two things [`StagedSetup::commit`] refuses that no operation can
//!
//! Every rule above is a fact about ONE edit, so an operation can check it.
//! Two are facts about the setup as a WHOLE, and they are the two ways a
//! screen could report success while nothing works:
//!
//! - **a controller that binds nothing** ([`StageRefusal::NoBindings`]) — the
//!   pad plugs, the game sees a controller, every button is dead;
//! - **an unanswered split-or-freeze question**
//!   ([`StageRefusal::BlockingUnanswered`]) — resolving it to
//!   [`Blocking::default`] would silently freeze a first-run user's keyboard,
//!   and would overwrite a returning user's own answer with one they were
//!   never shown.
//!
//! Both live in `commit` and nowhere else, which is what makes them
//! unresurrectable: `commit` is the only door to a [`CommitSpec`], the save
//! path and the play path are both built from one, and
//! `ksx_api::StagedSetupView::ready` *is* `commit().is_ok()` — so the buttons
//! are not offered, and the verbs refuse if something offers them anyway.
