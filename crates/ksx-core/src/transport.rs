//! How a device is attached, and which capture backends that lets ksx use.
//!
//! # The rule this module exists to state once
//!
//! **A Bluetooth keyboard can be captured by Interception and can never be
//! WinUSB-claimed.** Both halves surprise people, and neither is guessable from
//! the rest of the codebase:
//!
//! - It *can* be Interception-captured because Interception is a class filter
//!   on the Windows keyboard stack. A paired Bluetooth keyboard is a
//!   keyboard-class devnode on that stack exactly like a USB one, so splitting
//!   it into virtual pads works today, with no new code.
//! - It can *never* be WinUSB-claimed because a claim is an INF that binds a
//!   **USB interface** by hardware id (`USB\VID_xxxx&PID_yyyy&MI_zz`). A
//!   Bluetooth device has no USB interface for such an INF to match. That is
//!   the transport, not a feature ksx has not written yet, and saying "not
//!   supported" would invite someone to wait for a release that cannot come.
//!
//! `docs/DEVICE-IDENTITY.md` §11 is the normative statement of both halves,
//! including the two refusals that fall out of them and the reason a Bluetooth
//! id has no rung to climb.
//!
//! # Why it lives in `ksx-core`
//!
//! `docs/SURFACES.md` §1: the backend owns state and every surface is a view.
//! The set of backends a device is eligible for is a ROSTER — the same shape as
//! [`crate::MAX_SLOTS`] — so it is decided here, once, and served. The
//! enumerators (`ksx-capture`), the claim planner (`ksx-platform`), the writer
//! (`ksx device pick`), the CLI report, Studio's Rust seam and Studio's
//! TypeScript island all read [`Reach::eligibility`] rather than each deciding
//! what "Bluetooth" implies. A sentence composed in TypeScript is the specific
//! bug that rule exists for.
//!
//! Nothing here reads hardware. It is a pure function of four facts a caller
//! has already established, which is why every wording below is exercised in
//! CI on any platform.
