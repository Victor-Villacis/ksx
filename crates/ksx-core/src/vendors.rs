//! Friendly names for USB vendors and boards — **display only**, by
//! construction.
//!
//! `docs/DEVICE-IDENTITY.md` §6 draws the line this module exists to hold:
//!
//! - A vendor id **may** choose a name to show a human. `Ultimarc I-PAC 4X`
//!   reads better than `USB\VID_D209&PID_0430&MI_00\7&1A2B3C4D&0&0000`, and
//!   picking that string is a lookup, not a decision.
//! - A vendor id **may not** gate capture, claiming, refusal or backend
//!   selection. ksx works with any HID keyboard interface; code that asks "is
//!   this an Ultimarc?" to decide *what to do* is the hardcoding the rewrite
//!   exists to remove.
//!
//! Everything here returns a `&str` or an `Option<&str>`. Nothing returns a
//! `bool`, and that is deliberate: `is_ipac()` is the shape that invites a
//! branch, and three separate copies of it are what this module replaces.
//!
//! # The bug that motivated it
//!
//! `ksx devices` on the representative setup printed:
//!
//! ```text
//!   USB\VID_D209&PID_15A2\6  "SpinTrak"  [I-PAC]
//! ```
//!
//! A SpinTrak is a trackball. It is not an I-PAC. Three copies of Ultimarc's
//! vendor id lived in three crates, each answering `is_ipac`/`is_ultimarc` from
//! the VID alone, so every Ultimarc product on the machine claimed to be the
//! one board the author happened to own. The device's own `iProduct` string
//! already said "SpinTrak" — the label was overriding better information with
//! worse.
//!
//! So the lookup is keyed on **vendor and product**, with the vendor as the
//! fallback, and the device's own product string always wins when it has one.
