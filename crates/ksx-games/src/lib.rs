//! ksx-games — game/profile launching and exit detection.
//!
//! `games.toml` itself lives in `ksx-config`; this crate owns the behaviour:
//!
//! - [`profile`] — a `[[game]]` entry resolved into something launchable
//!   (an executable ksx can hold a handle to, or a `steam://`-style URL it
//!   cannot), plus the checks that can be made *before* a pad is plugged.
//! - [`tracker`] — the pure exit-detection state machine: a configurable
//!   launcher threshold (10 s by default to accommodate multi-second launcher
//!   hand-offs, and configurable per profile), plus a `LauncherHandoff` state that
//!   follows a launcher to the process it started. Clock injected, no I/O,
//!   fully CI-testable.
//! - [`session`] — the thin layer that feeds the tracker real facts, behind a
//!   [`session::GameHost`] trait with a scriptable [`session::FakeHost`].
//!
//! # Two rules that are not negotiable
//!
//! **Launch last.** The game starts only after the pads are plugged and capture
//! is armed. Started earlier, it enumerates zero controllers and never looks
//! again.
//!
//! **Never kill the game.** ksx starts it as a convenience; it does not own it.
//! There is no kill primitive anywhere in this crate or in
//! `ksx_platform::process` — see that module's no-kill policy.
