//! A `[[game]]` profile turned into something launchable.
//!
//! Two shapes come out of `games.toml`, and they behave completely differently
//! once started:
//!
//! - **An executable.** ksx spawns it and holds a process handle. Liveness is a
//!   fact, not a guess.
//! - **A protocol URL** (`steam://rungameid/…`, `com.epicgames.launcher://…`).
//!   There is nothing to spawn — the shell hands the URL to an already-running
//!   launcher, which returns immediately. ksx never gets a handle to anything,
//!   so the only way to know when the game ends is to watch for a process by
//!   name. That is what `process_name` is for, and why a protocol profile
//!   without one cannot detect its own exit.
//!
//! Everything in this module is pure: no spawning, no filesystem beyond the
//! one existence check that `preflight` is *for*.
