//! When is the game over? A pure state machine, with the clock injected.
//!
//! # Launcher threshold and hand-off detection
//!
//! KSX treats an exit as the game ending only after the launched process has
//! lived beyond its configured threshold. Anything shorter may be a launcher
//! or shim: `steam.exe` hands the
//! request to the already-running client and returns; a Battle.net stub spawns
//! the real binary; MAME frontends `exec` through a `.bat`. Treating those
//! exits as "the player quit" would tear emulation down two seconds into a
//! session.
//!
//! A short exit alone is not enough to end the session; KSX follows the target
//! process when one is configured and reports when it cannot. That keeps
//! `ksx run --game` safe without losing the normal return to the frontend when
//! the game actually quits.
//!
//! # Why 3 seconds is too short for a general launcher
//!
//! A launcher can legitimately take **5 seconds** to hand off to an
//! already-running client and exit. Under a 3 s rule ksx would classify that as
//! the game itself quitting and stop emulation *while the game is still
//! loading*. The
//! threshold is now [`DEFAULT_LAUNCHER_GRACE_MS`] (10 s) and is configurable per
//! profile (`launcher_grace_ms` in `games.toml`), because the right value is a
//! property of the launcher, not of ksx.
//!
//! **The trade, stated honestly.** This threshold answers one question — "did
//! that process live long enough to have *been* the game?" — and both wrong
//! answers cost something:
//!
//! - **too low**: a slow launcher's exit is read as the game's, and emulation
//!   stops during a launch that is still in progress. That is the observed bug,
//!   and it is the expensive one: the player is left with a dead panel and no
//!   pads, and only an emergency escape or a restart fixes it.
//! - **too high**: a genuinely short play session (start, quit after 8 s) is
//!   read as a hand-off. ksx then hunts for `process_name` — finds nothing,
//!   because the game really has gone — and waits out the 60 s hand-off grace
//!   before saying so. Emulation keeps running for up to a minute longer than it
//!   needed to, which is untidy but harms nothing: the pads work, the escapes
//!   work, and with a `process_name` set the hunt gives up on its own.
//!
//! One failure strands a player mid-game; the other delays a teardown nobody is
//! waiting on. A 10 s default covers the five-second regression case while the
//! cost remains only seconds of extra emulation, so the default errs high.
//! A cabinet with a launcher slower still (a cold Battle.net on a spinning disk)
//! raises `launcher_grace_ms`; a MAME-only cabinet where every exit is the game
//! can lower it to 3 s.
//!
//! The 60 s hand-off hunt ([`DEFAULT_HANDOFF_GRACE_MS`]) is a **separate**
//! timer answering a different question — "how long do we look for the game the
//! launcher started?" — and is deliberately untouched by any of this.
//!
//! # What this adds: `LauncherHandoff`
//!
//! A short-lived launch is not the end of the session, it is a **hand-off**. So
//! the machine keeps the configured threshold and, when it trips, spends a
//! configurable grace period (60 s by default) hunting for the profile's
//! `process_name` in the process list. Find it → track *that* process to its
//! exit. Don't find it in time → say so, plainly, and keep running: the session
//! is still perfectly playable and every emergency escape still ends it.
//!
//! `steam://`-style profiles start in `LauncherHandoff` directly, because there
//! was never a process to hold in the first place.
//!
//! # Why it is a state machine and not a thread that sleeps
//!
//! Every input arrives as an [`Observation`]: a monotonic timestamp, whether
//! the launched process is still alive, and the current process list. Nothing
//! in here reads a clock, spawns anything, or touches the OS — so the whole
//! decision table (including the 60-second grace and the exit-confirmation
//! debounce) is exercised in microseconds by CI, on any platform, with fakes.
