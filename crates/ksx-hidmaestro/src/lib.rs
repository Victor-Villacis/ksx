//! ksx-hidmaestro — a Rust client for HIDMaestro's protocol.
//!
//! HIDMaestro (<https://github.com/hifihedgehog/HIDMaestro>, **MIT**) is a
//! user-mode (UMDF2) HID descriptor emulator. It is the only route to the
//! DualSense / Switch Pro / Xbox Series personas: ViGEmBus emulates X360 and
//! DS4 and nothing else, and the project is frozen
//! (`docs/ENHANCEMENTS.md` E1).
//!
//! # Status: written to spec, NOT verified against a live driver
//!
//! This build has no production implementation that maps HIDMaestro's shared
//! section, regardless of whether the driver is installed. Everything in this
//! crate is implemented against the protocol map in
//! `docs/research/padforge-code-audit.md` §3, which was extracted from
//! PadForge's working C# client. That map is a good spec — it records the
//! *bugs* as well as the shapes, which is the expensive half — but a spec is not
//! a measurement.
//!
//! What that means concretely:
//!
//! | Layer | Verified | How |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Seqlock discipline ([`seqlock`]) | **Yes** — real concurrency test | writer thread vs reader loop over shared atomics |
//! | Keepalive cadence ([`keepalive`]) | **Yes** — pure logic, derived constants | arithmetic against the three watchdogs |
//! | Axis routing by name ([`axis`], [`state`]) | **Yes** — pure logic | including a counterfactual that reproduces the phantom-trigger bug |
//! | Lifecycle order ([`context`]) | **Yes** — recorded call order | test double behind [`context::HmDriverApi`] |
//! | Feedback decode table ([`feedback`]) | **Table pinned, bytes unverified** | fixtures from the audit, incl. the BT length trap |
//! | Shared-section layout ([`shm`], [`state::HmGamepadState::encode`]) | **No** | the audit documents the field set and the discipline, not the byte layout |
//! | Anything touching a real device | **No** | there is no device to touch |
//!
//! Nothing here fakes a controller. On a machine without HIDMaestro,
//! [`driver::UnavailableDriver`] refuses with the probe evidence attached, and
//! `ksx doctor` reports the absence.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! - [`seqlock`] — the shared-memory latch and its read/write discipline. The
//!   consumer drives the cadence; **this crate spawns no threads**.
//! - [`keepalive`] — 16 ms idle-dedup, derived from three driver watchdogs.
//! - [`axis`] / [`state`] — HID-usage axes, routed **by role through the
//!   profile's map**, never positionally.
//! - [`profile`] — descriptor + axis map, PID-block detection.
//! - [`context`] — lifecycle, in the one order that works.
//! - [`feedback`] — the decode table, including the Bluetooth length trap.
//! - [`driver`] — availability probe and the honest not-installed driver.
//! - [`shm`] (Windows) — file-mapping storage for the latch.
