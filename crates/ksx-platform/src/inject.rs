//! Keystroke *injection* — the other half of a WinUSB claim.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Once the I-PAC's `MI_00` interface is bound to `winusb.sys` it is no longer a
//! keyboard. That is the whole point (blocking becomes structural — see
//! `docs/research/keyboard-capture-2026.md` §4), but it has a consequence the
//! Interception backend never had: **the panel stops typing**. LaunchBox and
//! RetroBat navigate their menus with keystrokes, so a claimed panel with no
//! emulation running is a dead panel.
//!
//! The answer is symmetric to the claim: ksx owns the device, so ksx is
//! responsible for putting the keystrokes back whenever it is *not* translating
//! them into pad state. [`Typethrough`] is that policy, [`KeyInjector`] is the
//! mechanism, and `SendInput` is the syscall.
//!
//! # Scancodes, not virtual keys
//!
//! Every stroke is sent with `KEYEVENTF_SCANCODE` and `wVk = 0`, plus
//! `KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY` for the E0 keys. That is deliberate:
//! [`ksx_core::Key`] *is* a set-1 scancode vocabulary, matching the make codes
//! Interception reads off the wire, so a scancode round
//! trip is the identity function. Sending virtual keys instead would push every
//! stroke through the foreground layout, and an arcade panel that types `Z` on a
//! QWERTY desktop and `W` on an AZERTY one is not a fixed panel. The one
//! exception is [`Key::Pause`], which has no single-scancode form at all — see
//! [`KeyStroke::VirtualKey`].
//!
//! # Honest limits of SendInput (read these before trusting it)
//!
//! `SendInput` injects at the *top* of the input stack, above every driver.
//! It is not a driver, and it cannot pretend to be one:
//!
//! - **Injected strokes are flagged.** `LLKHF_INJECTED` (and
//!   `LLKHF_LOWER_IL_INJECTED` when the sender is less privileged) is set on
//!   every one. Anti-cheat that rejects injected input will reject these; so
//!   will some games' raw-input paths, because `SendInput` never produces a
//!   `WM_INPUT` from a real HID device. Frontend menus (the actual use case)
//!   read ordinary `WM_KEYDOWN` and are fine.
//! - **The secure desktop is unreachable.** UAC consent, the lock screen,
//!   Ctrl+Alt+Del and the login screen run on a separate desktop that no
//!   user-mode injection can touch. On a machine whose only keyboard is a
//!   WinUSB-claimed panel you cannot type your PIN. Keep a real keyboard —
//!   `ksx winusb claim` refuses to take the last one for exactly this reason.
//! - **UIPI applies.** A non-elevated ksx cannot inject into an elevated
//!   window. `SendInput` returns a short count; [`InjectError::Blocked`] is that
//!   case, and it is a *report*, not a retry loop.
//! - **It is not the physical device.** Nothing downstream can tell which panel
//!   a re-injected key came from, because there is no device behind it any more.
//!   Per-device identity survives only inside ksx.
//!
//! Every injected event carries [`KSX_EXTRA_INFO`] in `dwExtraInfo` so ksx's own
//! hooks (and anyone debugging with Spy++) can recognise its own traffic. With a
//! WinUSB claim there is no feedback path to loop through — the claimed
//! interface cannot see injected input — but the tag costs nothing and the
//! Interception/RawInput backends share this module.
