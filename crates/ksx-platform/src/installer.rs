//! `ksx install-drivers` — verify the bundled ViGEmBus installer, then plan.
//!
//! The rule this module exists to enforce: **nothing is executed before its
//! identity is proven, and nothing can change between the proof and the use.**
//! The bundled installer is a kernel-driver setup running elevated; if it were
//! swapped, everything downstream is moot. So the order is always
//!
//! 1. locate the bundled file — in a directory a standard user cannot write,
//! 2. open it **once**, denying writers and deleters ([`crate::sealed`]),
//! 3. SHA-256 it *through that handle* against the value in `docs/DRIVERS.md`,
//! 4. check its Authenticode chain *through that same handle*, and that the
//!    signer really is Nefarius,
//! 5. only then offer to run it — still holding the handle, and targeting the
//!    path the handle itself resolves to.
//!
//! Both pins are required. A hash alone cannot notice that we recorded the hash
//! of a *tampered* file; a signature alone cannot notice that someone swapped
//! ViGEmBus 1.22.0 for a differently-signed Nefarius binary. Two independent
//! pins is the point.
//!
//! # The signature policy, and why an expired certificate can still pass
//!
//! Step 4 is not "the certificate is valid today". Code-signing certificates
//! are issued for a year or two; the binaries they sign outlive them by design,
//! and that is what the timestamp countersignature is *for*. Windows itself
//! resolves this by asking whether the file was signed **while** the
//! certificate was live, and accepts it forever after if so. ksx does the same
//! — see [`SignatureVerdict`] — with one addition: the timestamp is verified
//! rather than assumed. A countersignature nobody checked is decoration.
//!
//! So there are three distinct outcomes for a correctly-signed Nefarius binary,
//! and they are reported as three states with three codes, never as one bool:
//!
//! | state | code | run it? |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | certificate still inside its window | `valid` | yes |
//! | certificate expired, verified timestamp covers the signing time | `expired-timestamp-verified` | yes |
//! | certificate expired, no timestamp survives checking | `expired-no-valid-timestamp` | **no** |
//!
//! Everything else — wrong signer, untrusted chain, unsigned, bad hash — is
//! refused exactly as before.
//!
//! # Threat model (why steps 1 and 2 exist at all)
//!
//! `ksx install-drivers` is the one ksx command that runs with an administrator
//! token. Everything it executes is therefore a privilege boundary, and the two
//! classic ways across it are:
//!
//! - **A user-writable search path.** If the search included, say, a `drivers\`
//!   folder next to a development build under `C:\Users\…`, any standard user
//!   (or any code running as them) could drop a file there and have an admin
//!   run it. [`locate`] refuses candidate directories a standard user can write
//!   **whenever this process is elevated** — which is the only case where the
//!   refusal matters, because a non-elevated process can never reach
//!   [`Action::Ready`] anyway. Net effect: execution is only ever possible from
//!   a protected directory.
//! - **Time-of-check to time-of-use.** Verifying by path and then executing by
//!   path means two `open()`s with a window in between. Closed by
//!   [`crate::sealed::SealedFile`]; the exact guarantee is documented there.
//!
//! Everything except the Authenticode call and the execution step is pure, so
//! the plan, the verdicts and the rendering are unit-tested on any platform
//! with fixtures.
