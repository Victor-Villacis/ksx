//! Read-only PnP device-tree enumeration.
//!
//! One `CM_Get_Device_ID_ListW(CM_GETIDLIST_FILTER_PRESENT)` call plus registry
//! reads under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum`. That combination is
//! deliberate:
//!
//! - **Present-only.** The `Enum` tree is a graveyard — this machine has 38
//!   keyboard-class nodes in the registry and one of them is the I-PAC. Counting
//!   from the registry alone would make the "is this the last keyboard?" refusal
//!   meaningless, and that refusal is the thing standing between a user and a
//!   panel they cannot type on.
//! - **Nothing is opened.** `CM_Get_Device_ID_List` returns strings.
//!   `SetupDiOpenDeviceInterface`, `CreateFile` on a device path, and every
//!   `winusb.sys` claim primitive are absent from this module on purpose: a
//!   survey must never be able to disturb the thing it is surveying.
