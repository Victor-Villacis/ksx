//! The WinUSB rebind lifecycle: survey, claim, release.
//!
//! # What a "claim" is
//!
//! The I-PAC is a USB composite device. Its keyboard lives on interface `MI_00`,
//! which Windows binds to `HidUsb` → `hidclass` → `kbdhid` → `kbdclass`.
//! *Claiming* it means rebinding that one interface to Microsoft's in-box
//! `winusb.sys`, after which ksx reads the HID interrupt-IN endpoint directly
//! with `nusb`. Two properties fall out for free, and they are the entire reason
//! M6 exists (`docs/research/keyboard-capture-2026.md` §4):
//!
//! - **Blocking is structural.** The interface is not in the keyboard stack any
//!   more, so nothing else on the machine can see a keystroke from it. No filter
//!   driver, no hook, no race — and no cross-signed `keyboard.sys` waiting for
//!   the 2026 enforcement flip to stop loading.
//! - **Identity is structural.** One `nusb` device per board, keyed on the
//!   instance path. No 10-slot ceiling, no id drift on replug, and two identical
//!   I-PACs stop being indistinguishable (`docs/USE-CASES.md` T4).
//!
//! # What this module does and does not do
//!
//! It **plans**. [`survey`] reads the device tree (read-only — see
//! `win::devices`), [`plan_claim`] and [`plan_release`] turn a request into an
//! INF plus an ordered list of `pnputil` invocations, and [`apply`] runs one of
//! those lists. Every mutating verb in `ksx winusb` is dry-run by default and
//! needs an explicit `--yes`, so the normal outcome of asking for a claim is a
//! printed INF and a printed command line.
//!
//! Nothing here opens or claims a device. The read side is registry + one
//! `CM_Get_Device_ID_List` call; the write side is `pnputil.exe`, which means
//! the rebind is auditable, reproducible by hand, and reversible by the same
//! tool with no ksx involved.
//!
//! # The refusal that matters
//!
//! [`plan_claim`] counts *present* keyboard-class devices and refuses to claim
//! the last one ([`Refusal::LastKeyboard`], exit 2). Claiming the only keyboard
//! on a machine leaves the user with no way to type the release command, no way
//! through a UAC prompt, and no way onto the lock screen — `SendInput`
//! re-injection cannot reach the secure desktop (see [`crate::inject`]). That is
//! not a warning, it is a refusal.
//!
//! # Signing (the honest part)
//!
//! `winusb.sys` itself is in-box and WHQL-signed, so it is immune to the 2026
//! cross-signed cliff. The *INF that points at it* is a third-party INF, and
//! 64-bit Windows will not install one without a trusted catalog. There is no
//! way around that from inside ksx. [`ClaimPlan::signing_note`] prints the two
//! real options — a self-signed catalog in the machine's Trusted Root +
//! Trusted Publishers stores (what Zadig/libwdi automate), or attestation
//! signing through Partner Center — and `ksx winusb claim --yes` reports the
//! resulting `pnputil` failure verbatim rather than pretending it worked.
