//! **Studio's half of the live input feed: the daemon's stream, as Server-Sent
//! Events.**
//!
//! One route, `GET /api/live`, and one job: take the [`ksx_api::LiveStream`]
//! this process opens on `\\.\pipe\ksx-live` and hand it to a browser without
//! ever letting the browser's pace reach the machine that owns the keyboard.
//!
//! ```text
//!  \\.\pipe\ksx-live ──▶ spawn_blocking bridge ──▶ mpsc(1) ──▶ SSE ──▶ EventSource
//!   (one JSON line              blocking_send        the        text/event-
//!    per frame)                                   backpressure   stream
//!                                                    meeting
//!                                                     point
//! ```
//!
//! # Why SSE and not a WebSocket
//!
//! This stream is **one-directional** — the browser has nothing to say back;
//! every write it wants is already a POST to a route beside this one, going
//! through the same `ControlSource` verb the CLI uses. Given that, SSE wins on
//! every axis that matters here:
//!
//! - **It is HTTP.** Same origin, same `guard.rs` layer, same CSP
//!   (`connect-src 'self'`), same 303-and-flash world as every other route. A
//!   WebSocket upgrade is a second protocol with a second set of rules to get
//!   right, and it would need its own answer to the DNS-rebinding check the
//!   guard already applies to everything.
//! - **It reconnects by itself.** `EventSource` retries on its own, with a
//!   server-settable interval — which is exactly the behaviour wanted when the
//!   daemon is restarted under a page that is left open. A WebSocket client
//!   has to be taught to do that, in TypeScript, correctly, including the
//!   backoff.
//! - **It is far less code.** No upgrade handshake, no ping/pong, no close
//!   codes, no frame masking. The whole client is `new EventSource('/api/live')`
//!   plus an `onmessage`.
//!
//! The one thing a WebSocket would buy — a browser→daemon channel — is the one
//! thing that must NOT exist here: a surface that could push into the input
//! pipeline over a socket is a second control surface, and the whole
//! architecture is that every write is a verb (docs/SURFACES.md §1).
//!
//! If a future consumer genuinely needs to talk back (the E8 light bus is a
//! candidate — a lamp driver that wants to *set* an LED), that is a verb on
//! the control pipe, not a duplex socket bolted onto this.
//!
//! # Backpressure: one bounded slot, and it blocks
//!
//! The channel between the bridge thread and the response body is **capacity
//! one, and the bridge BLOCKS on it**. That is the whole design, and every
//! alternative was worse:
//!
//! - an unbounded queue grows without limit behind a tab that stopped reading
//!   — the thing this must never do;
//! - a bounded queue that *drops* would need its own counter, and then a frame
//!   would carry two different "you missed some" numbers from two different
//!   hops, which a reader has to add up correctly to get a true answer.
//!
//! Blocking gives one counter and keeps it true. A stalled browser fills the
//! TCP window → the body stops being polled → this channel stays full → the
//! bridge parks in `blocking_send` → it stops reading the pipe → the daemon's
//! writer parks in `WriteFile` → **the daemon's subscription queue fills and
//! the sink drops, counting into that subscriber's `dropped`** — which is
//! reported to this same consumer in the next frame that gets through
//! (`ksx-backend/src/daemon/live_pipe.rs`). Every buffer in the chain is bounded,
//! nothing anywhere waits on the capture thread, and the number the page shows
//! is the number that is true.
//!
//! # And when there is no daemon
//!
//! The endpoint answers, cleanly and at once, with one `unavailable` event
//! carrying the [`ksx_api::codes::NO_CHANNEL`] refusal and its remedy — never
//! a hang, and never an empty stream that looks like a quiet panel. The
//! close-freeze bug (a read with no deadline on a UI thread) is the reason
//! that sentence is worth writing down; the pipe open is budgeted, and the
//! blocking read that follows it lives on a `spawn_blocking` thread that owns
//! nothing else.
