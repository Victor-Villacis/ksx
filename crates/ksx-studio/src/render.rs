//! The render seam: embedded FMIR + per-request [`StatusSnapshot`] /
//! [`SessionView`] → HTML, with the same data emitted twice — slots for the
//! SSR first paint, the source payload for client hydration.
//!
//! # SSR slots for first paint, a payload block for hydration (and why both)
//!
//! The page is one Forma ISLAND (`StatusIsland`, compiled between
//! ISLAND_START/ISLAND_END opcodes). Per request this seam:
//!
//! 1. **Injects slots** exactly as v3 did — the compiler declares NAMED slots
//!    in the FMIR slot table, [`SlotData`] is populated before the IR walk,
//!    and the walker renders the full page server-side. This is what the
//!    browser paints before (or without) any JavaScript — the no-JS
//!    experience is still the complete v3 page, plus a `<noscript>` meta
//!    refresh so it keeps updating.
//! 2. **Emits the SAME data as the domain payload** — a [`StatusPayload`]
//!    JSON in the [`PAYLOAD_SCRIPT_ID`] script block (a non-executing
//!    `type="application/json"` data block, so the strict CSP is untouched).
//!    The client seeds its signals from it BEFORE adoption — dogfood ledger
//!    #5: adoption binds effects that immediately write signal state into the
//!    DOM, so plain hydration clobbers SSR values; seeding first is the one
//!    sanctioned live path. After adoption a 2 s poller rewrites the same
//!    signals from `GET /api/status`, which serves the identical
//!    [`StatusPayload`] shape (parity pinned by
//!    `the_payload_block_matches_the_api_payload_shape`).
//!
//!    Keeping BOTH emissions is deliberate: slots alone give a correct first
//!    paint but hydration would clobber it (ledger #5); the payload alone
//!    would require client rendering and break the no-JS baseline. The
//!    redundancy is the design, not an accident — same struct, same
//!    serializer, one derivation mirror (StatusIsland.ts) covered by tests on
//!    this side.
//!
//!    Since compiler 0.3.1 the walker ALSO emits `data-forma-props` on the
//!    island root, built from the island's `slot_ids` (ledger #8 closed — the
//!    `__forma_islands` impersonation this file used to hand-emit is gone).
//!    Those native props carry the rendered SLOT values; the block above
//!    carries the SOURCE payload the client's own model needs. Ledger #19.
//!
//! Three flavours of slot exist on this page:
//!
//! - **Scalars** — every `createSignal` in `studio-ui/src/StatusIsland.ts`
//!   becomes a slot named after the signal getter. Unique names, injected via
//!   [`SlotData::from_json`] (name-keyed, defaults preserved for misses).
//!   Compiler 0.3.1 walks island component files for signal scopes, so the
//!   twin re-declarations `StatusPage.ts` used to carry are gone (ledger #9).
//! - **Lists** — every `createList` becomes an Array slot. Since the v4
//!   lists read from named signals (`() => padTiles()`), compiler 0.2.0
//!   derives the slot name from the BINDING (`list:padTiles:array`) instead
//!   of the positional `list:#N:array` v3 lived with — reordering lists in
//!   the page no longer shifts names (ledger #3, mostly resolved for us).
//!   Injected by NAME; the `LIST_SLOT_*` constants pin the five names.
//! - **Shows** — every `createShow` becomes a Bool slot named after its
//!   CONDITION binding (`createShow(() => canStart(), …)` →
//!   `show:canStart`), so shows are injected by name like everything else
//!   (compiler 0.3.1; dogfood ledger #4 closed 2026-08-06 — the `SHOW_ORDER`
//!   positional array and its "append, never insert" rule are gone). The show
//!   pairs are what color state server-side (the server picks which
//!   statically-styled variant renders), and after hydration the same pairs
//!   flip live from client signals.
//!
//! `tests::embedded_ir_slot_layout_matches_the_seam` pins the exact list slot
//! NAMES (order included), the exact show slot NAMES, and the island table
//! including its non-empty `slot_ids` — a compiler bump that renames slots,
//! or a StatusIsland.ts edit that adds/renames lists or shows, is a test
//! failure, not a silently blank section. It then hands the whole slot table
//! to [`assert_island_slot_contract`], which asserts the thing a name-exists
//! check cannot: that every name the seam injects is one the ISLAND RENDERS,
//! and that every scalar the island renders is one the seam injects. Read that
//! function before touching this seam — "the slot exists" was the assertion
//! that let a dead slot through the whole gate on 2026-08-06.
//!
//! History: compiler 0.1.8 named EVERY list `list:array`, and this seam
//! resolved lists positionally too (a `LIST_ORDER` table, since deleted).
//! Per-instance slot naming was the upstream feature request this page
//! dogfooded (docs/ENHANCEMENTS.md E7 loop); fixed upstream in
//! `@getforma/compiler` 0.2.0, adopted 2026-08-05 — the E7 dogfood loop's
//! first closed cycle. Per-instance `createShow` naming (ledger #4) and
//! populated island `slot_ids` (ledger #8) landed in 0.3.1 and were adopted
//! 2026-08-06; the same release stopped extracting signals from the root
//! `*Page` file ONLY (ledger #9), which is why `StatusPage.ts` is now four
//! lines instead of thirty declarations.
