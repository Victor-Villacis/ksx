//! The /check render seam: embedded FMIR + one [`CheckPayload`] → HTML.
//!
//! **The button check** (docs/MAPPER-UX.md Build C): press a panel key, and
//! every virtual control it drives lights on every slot at once. Same four-part
//! slot seam as [`crate::render`] — scalars, lists, shows, and the layout test
//! that pins all three — so read `render.rs`'s module docs for the protocol.
//! What is worth writing down here is what is different about this page.
//!
//! # This page has two data channels, and only one of them is here
//!
//! Everything this seam renders is STRUCTURE, read from disk: which slots
//! exist, which controls each preset names, which keys drive them. The
//! lighting-up arrives on `GET /api/live` — Server-Sent Events over the
//! daemon's own feed pipe (`crate::live`) — at display rate, and never touches
//! a slot value.
//!
//! That split is the page. An echo carried in this payload would be as fast as
//! an HTTP poll, and a button check that answers "did that press arrive?"
//! two seconds later is not a button check. It also means the SSR paint is
//! genuinely useful with no daemon at all: the binding table is correct
//! whatever the pipe is doing, so the page still answers *what this key should
//! do* while honestly saying it cannot answer *whether it did*.
//!
//! # The seam decides nothing about controls
//!
//! The chip roster is `MapperSlot::bindings`' key set — every function the
//! saved layout names, unbound ones included. Its canonical spelling stays in
//! `data-control` for the live lookup; the visible chip uses the controller's
//! customer-facing identity. The roster itself is never hardcoded, because a
//! stock-only list would quietly omit exactly the extension control somebody
//! added and is now standing at the cabinet trying to test.
