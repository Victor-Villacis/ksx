//! The `/devices` render seam: embedded FMIR + one per-request
//! [`DevicesPayload`] → HTML, with the same data emitted twice — slots for the
//! SSR first paint, the source payload for client hydration.
//!
//! Structurally identical to `render.rs` and `render_map.rs`, and deliberately
//! so: four seams (scalars, lists, shows, `build_slots`), one page entry, one
//! layout test that calls [`crate::render::assert_island_slot_contract`]. Read
//! `render.rs`'s module docs for why the data is emitted twice and why "the
//! slot exists" is not the check.
//!
//! # What this page decides, and what it must not
//!
//! Nothing here reads hardware, resolves a device id, or judges whether a
//! board can be picked. All of that is [`ksx_api::DeviceScanView`], composed by
//! `ksx-backend`'s `device_scan::view` from the same enumeration `ksx device scan`
//! prints — `docs/SURFACES.md` §1: a capability is a typed spec and a pure plan
//! in the backend, and surfaces render the result. What this file does is turn
//! that view into the exact strings the island draws, and it does that because
//! the island's twin (`studio-ui/src/DevicesIsland.ts`) has to produce the
//! identical strings per poll. Every function below has a mirror there; the
//! tests at the bottom pin this side.
//!
//! # Three rules this page inherits and one it adds
//!
//! Inherited: no logic in the page (§1), exact-device prepare/release only
//! through the guarded Setup flow, and every mutating route is a 303
//! post-redirect-get with the outcome in `?flash=`. The one machine-wide
//! elevated action here is the orphaned-certificate sweep: it accepts no
//! device, subject, thumbprint, store or path and reaches only the installed
//! fixed-purpose helper.
//!
//! Added: **an optional line is rendered and hidden, never omitted.** A
//! `createShow` inside a `createList` is not a shape this compiler emits, so a
//! row that sometimes carries a PORT-PINNED warning carries the element on
//! every row and a per-row class (`portWarnCls`) decides whether it is
//! visible. That is why so many fields below come in `(text, class)` pairs.
