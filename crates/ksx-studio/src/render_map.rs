//! The mapper page's render seam (`/map`): embedded FMIR + per-request
//! [`MapPayload`] → HTML. Same architecture as `render.rs` (SSR slots for
//! first paint, the identical payload as island props for hydration — dogfood
//! ledger #5), same compiler constraints, its own slot layout.
//!
//! # The zone model
//!
//! The controller art (Gamepad-Asset-Pack, MIT — see `studio-ui/art/README.md`)
//! is an `<img>` filling the bottom `ART_SHARE` of a fixed-aspect "stage";
//! the top band holds the LB/RB/LT/RT chips (the icon art does not draw
//! shoulders), stacked trigger-over-bumper and visually anchored to the body
//! silhouette below. Every mappable control is a HIT ZONE: an absolutely
//! positioned
//! `<button data-fn=…>` from the [`ZONE_XBOX`]/[`ZONE_DS4`] tables.
//!
//! v7 — **every zone wears its own IDENTITY** (requirement: "I can see G is mapped
//! to A but I can't see the A xbox button"). The vendored art is a line
//! drawing with no letters on it, so the zone renders the control's name
//! itself: a persona-aware glyph in the canonical colours (A green, B red,
//! X blue, Y amber; ✕ blue, ○ red, △ green, □ pink), LB/RB/LT/RT and
//! view/menu/guide as text chips, arrows for the dpad and the stick wedges.
//!
//! v16 — direction glyphs are UNIFIED ON ARROWS (`↑ ↓ ← →`, not `▲ ▼ ◀ ▶`)
//! everywhere, art included. The macro grid gives every direction group its
//! own eight-position ring (`↑ ↖ ← ↙ ↓ ↘ → ↗`), so ALL FOUR diagonals are
//! columns you can point at — a 360 walks every one of them — and `◤◥◣◢` are
//! corner *blocks*, not directions: a diagonal that did not look like the same
//! family as its two parents would defeat the whole lens (see `fold`, below).
//! The bound key rides UNDER the identity as the small mono `ztag` — identity
//! always, key tag whenever the stage is wide enough for it (a container query
//! drops the tag on a phone; the legend still carries every key). An unbound
//! control therefore still reads as a controller, which is the whole point.
//!
//! The readable truth is the bindings LEGEND below the stage: one row per
//! function (same identity glyph + group prefix + key tag), carrying the same
//! `data-fn` so a row click is exactly the zone click, and hover
//! cross-highlights via the client's shared hot signal. One `createList`
//! renders all 25 zones, another the 25 legend rows; geometry is data, not
//! markup.
//!
//! # Shared keys are information, never a conflict
//!
//! One key driving several controls is native to the engine (`preset.rs`: "one
//! key → many functions"; docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §1a) and is exactly what
//! v7's multi-select flow writes. Both readers say so instead of complaining:
//! a control whose key is also bound elsewhere in the same preset gets
//! `z-shared`/`l-shared` (a cool-toned key tag), and its legend row carries a
//! compact "also A · B" badge naming the co-bound controls.
//!
//! Zone coordinates are STAGE percentages, authored from the art's real
//! geometry (`studio-ui/art/extents.mjs` — the PadForge lesson: derive layout
//! from art with a script, never trace by eye) plus hand placement for the
//! shoulders and the small center buttons — which `build.mjs` now also draws
//! into the recolored art at the same coordinates. The tables
//! are mirrored in `studio-ui/src/MapIsland.ts` (client re-derivation per
//! poll — the established applyStatus pattern); `zone_tables_cover_every_
//! mappable_function` pins this side.

// docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §6.2, adopted from TAStudio: "rows = steps,
// columns = the slot's controls, cells = held or not". That beats a form with
// an "add step" button because a timed sequence is a SHAPE — you have to see
// ↓, ↘, → as three rows with the diagonal overlapping to know you wrote a
// quarter-circle rather than three unrelated presses.
//
// v11 shipped this READ-ONLY, when §1c's "authoring the sequence itself stays
// TOML-only" was still true and the only output was a block to paste. It is
// not true any more: the daemon grew `map-macro`, which takes ONE WHOLE
// `[macros.<name>]` table ([`crate::control::ControlSource::save_macro`],
// `POST /api/macro/save`, `ksx macro`). So v12 wires the card to it — New,
// Save, Rename and Delete are real writes through that one verb — and the
// TOML block is demoted to a collapsed "copy for sharing" detail.
//
// The SAVE MODEL is explicit-Save, not save-per-edit (the rationale is in
// MapIsland.ts, where the buttons live: a macro write takes a backup and
// hot-swaps the sequence into the running session, so autosaving every painted
// cell would publish half-authored sequences and litter backups). Everything
// that WRITES is JavaScript-only, so the SSR paint below renders the same card
// in its read state — plus the honest note that says which of the two it is.
//
// Every derivation below is mirrored in MapIsland.ts (server derives the SSR
// paint, the client re-derives per edit and per poll), the established rule
// for this page.

// Requirement: "if down and right together equals diagonal, the user does not care —
// we can present the diagonal in the piano and the user can select it, and
// behind the scenes we do down and right, so it's seamless."
//
// He is right, and it is the root cause of the evening he lost. A diagonal IS
// two simultaneous holds — that is ksx's implementation detail, not the user's
// concept. Players think in ↘ / down-forward / numpad 3, never in "two axis
// bindings held together", and no mapper in the field lets them pick one
// (Steam Input: four cardinal binding slots; reWASD's own answer: build a
// Shortcut out of two zones; MAME: four cardinals; GP2040-CE: cardinal pairs).
//
// NOTHING STORED CHANGES. A step still holds a set of ordinary bindings, so
// files stay hand-editable, the engine is untouched, and old presets keep
// working. This is the lens: `fold` reads a hold and says how to PRESENT it;
// what a pick writes is the pair, spelled exactly as `ksx map` would.
//
// MIRROR of `ksx_core::diagonal` + `ksx_core::socd::pointing`, over FUNCTION
// NAMES rather than `Binding` (ksx-studio links no ksx crate at runtime — the
// established pattern, same as the zone tables). `the_diagonal_lens_matches_
// ksx_core` pins the two against each other through the TEST-ONLY dev-deps.
