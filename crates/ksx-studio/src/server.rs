//! The blocking axum server around the render seam.
//!
//! GET / renders the page (SSR + island props); GET /api/status serves the
//! same [`StatusPayload`] as JSON for the island's 2 s poller (same-origin
//! only — the CSP's `connect-src 'self'` is exactly what permits the fetch).
//! The three POST routes each perform one [`ControlSource`] verb and
//! 303-redirect back to /, carrying the outcome in a `flash` query parameter
//! — plain HTML forms remain the baseline (`form-action 'self'`), which the
//! client optionally upgrades to fetch-submits that read the redirect's
//! flash without a reload.
//!
//! v15 adds `/pads`, and it takes its facts from a THIRD provider:
//! [`ksx_api::MachineSource`], beside the existing status and control ones.
//! Neither of those could answer it — `StatusSource` reads the config store
//! and `ControlSource` the daemon pipe, and a ViGEm bus is neither. Its two
//! verbs keep the CLI's consent shape rather than inventing one: a spawn is
//! bounded (it unplugs itself, because a page has no Ctrl+C) and a prune is a
//! DRY RUN unless the form carries `confirm=yes`.
//!
//! v9 gives the MAPPER the same baseline: `/map/*` are form-encoded twins of
//! the `/api/*` mapper verbs (bind, clear, restore, clear-all, pause), each
//! calling the identical [`ControlSource`] method and 303-ing back to
//! `/map?slot=N&flash=…`. With JavaScript the island intercepts the submit
//! and reports through its toast stack instead; with JavaScript off the page
//! is still fully operable, which is the whole point of the shape.

// DELETED at forma-server 0.2.0: `relax_style_src`.
//
// Dogfood ledger #13 — a nonce in `style-src` makes browsers drop
// `'unsafe-inline'` semantics per spec, so every inline `style=""` ATTRIBUTE
// was ignored; forma's own compiled bindings emit those (the mapper's zone
// geometry, the countdown bar's width), and all 25 hit zones collapsed into a
// pile at the stage's top-left. The workaround rewrote the directive to
// `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`.
//
// 0.2.0 fixes it properly: the policy now carries
// `style-src-attr 'unsafe-inline'` alongside a still-nonce-locked `style-src`,
// so attribute styles apply while `<style>` blocks and stylesheets keep their
// nonce. Nothing to work around.
//
// Keeping it would have been actively harmful, and invisibly so. It matched
// `directive.starts_with("style-src")`, which catches `style-src-attr` too —
// so it would have DESTROYED the new directive and stripped the nonce off the
// real one, leaving a strictly weaker policy than upstream ships. The page
// would have rendered perfectly throughout, because the relaxed `style-src` it
// substituted still permits the inline styles the mapper needs. A workaround
// that silently outlives its bug is worse than the bug.
