//! **The touch contract, enforced — and the cascade trap that made it a lie.**
//!
//! `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` §2 and §11 both promise that under
//! `@media (pointer: coarse)` the control vocabulary grows to a 40 px minimum
//! (36 px for the small tier), "because a cabinet screen is touched". Until
//! 2026-08-08 that promise was written as a list of component selectors, and
//! **in the rendered output it was false for every field on every screen**.
//!
//! The reason is pure cascade, not CSS exotica. The coarse block sat in §4.3,
//! and §4.4 — thirty lines BELOW it — re-declares
//!
//! ```css
//! select, input[type="text"], input[type="number"] { min-height: var(--ctl-h); }
//! ```
//!
//! Same specificity, later in the file, so the later rule wins and the media
//! query does nothing. Measured against the HTML `render_pads` /
//! `render_profiles` / `render_setup` / `render_devices` actually emit, in
//! Chromium with touch emulation on: /pads' three spawn selects, /profiles'
//! six new-profile fields, /setup's five selects and /devices' alias box all
//! rendered 36 px. Nobody had ever measured them, because reading the source
//! shows a `@media (pointer: coarse)` block that says 2.5rem and looks right —
//! the same "audit the OUTPUT, not the source" failure that
//! `render.rs::assert_complete_head` was written for.
//!
//! # What this file checks
//!
//! Two things, and neither of them restates the fix:
//!
//! 1. **[`no_coarse_declaration_is_cancelled_by_a_later_unconditional_rule`]**
//!    — the general form of the bug. A declaration inside `(pointer: coarse)`
//!    exists to be an *exception*; an unconditional rule that lands later in
//!    the file with an identical selector and a covering property silently
//!    cancels it, in a way no reader of either rule can see. This is a lint
//!    over the whole stylesheet, so it catches the next one too, wherever it
//!    is added. **It fails against the pre-fix studio.css on exactly the three
//!    field selectors that were dead**, and on nothing else.
//!
//! 2. **[`touch_grows_the_ladder_itself`]** — the ladder tokens are what the
//!    fix moves, and they are re-derived here rather than restated: 40 px is
//!    the number DESIGN-SYSTEM §2/§11 print, and a token that stops meeting it
//!    means the doc is lying again. Fails against the pre-fix file, which has
//!    no `:root` inside a coarse query at all.
//!
//! Neither test can see a browser, and neither pretends to: the geometry was
//! measured by hand, once, and what is pinned here is the pair of *structural*
//! properties that made the measurement come out wrong.
