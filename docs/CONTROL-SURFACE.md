# ksx Control Surface

The contract every ksx front end builds against. See `ENHANCEMENTS.md` E5/E7
for the milestones, `M9-DECISION.md` for why the GUI is Studio rather than an
egui window, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the thread model everything below defers
to.

**The standing rule: every front-door action must map to an existing backend
verb — no GUI-only code paths.** A button in the cabinet window is a
`DaemonCommand` enqueued through the daemon's own dispatch; a button in Studio
is a `ksx-api` call wrapping the same verb. If an operation has no verb, the
GUI does not get the operation until the verb exists — which makes the gap list
below the GUI's dependency list, not a wish list.

## The two surfaces: the cabinet OPERATES, Studio AUTHORS (2026-08-06)

**One rule decides which surface gets a feature, and one test decides whether
it belongs on the cabinet at all.**

> **The cabinet OPERATES — choose among things that already exist. Studio
> AUTHORS — create, edit, name, delete.**
>
> *Can it be done with a joystick, two buttons, no text entry, in ten seconds,
> by someone standing at the cab with a game about to start?*

| | ksx cabinet (`--features cabinet`) | ksx Studio (`--features studio`) |
|---|---|---|
| where | the machine's own screen, read at six feet, driven by the arcade panel | a desk, or a phone at the cab, with a pointer and a keyboard |
| what | press a button and watch both columns; is it working; start/stop; which game profile; which preset each slot uses | the mapper, the macro editor, preset files, backups, templates |
| never | a mapper, a macro editor, preset file management — **ever** | — |

The split is not enforced by review. `crates/ksx-cabinet` links `ksx-api` and
egui and **nothing else**: no pipe client, no config store, no `DaemonCommand`.
And the in-daemon window's own dispatch (`ksx-backend/src/cabinet.rs`) is built with
its preset writers set to REFUSALS that name the surface which can do it — so a
cabinet that ever tried to send `map`, `map-macro`, `map-restore`,
`map-clear-all` **or `learn-key`** is refused by its own table, in words, on
screen. `learn-key` is on that list because learning a key exists to fill in a
binding, which is authoring; its refusal is **synchronous**
(`LearnService::refusing`), because a learner that answers "listening" and only
fails on a later poll is a lock that stands open for ten seconds. The whole
table is asserted, not reviewed: `cabinet::tests::
the_in_daemon_dispatch_refuses_every_authoring_verb_in_words`.

**Driving it is the hard part, and it has two paths** (`ksx-cabinet/src/pad.rs`):
with emulation **stopped** the panel is an ordinary keyboard (or typethrough is
re-injecting its keys) and winit sees it; with emulation **running** the panel
is captured below win32k and deliberately muted from typethrough, so winit sees
**nothing at all** — and the window reads `XInputGetState` against ksx's own
virtual pads instead. Both paths are read every frame, so the transition is
invisible to the person at the cabinet. The window only consumes pad input while
it has focus: while a session runs, those presses are also playing the game.

**The hole in that, stated rather than discovered.** The second path is XInput,
and XInput is Xbox personas only. A cabinet whose slots are all `playstation`
(a DS4 on plain HID — which is what MAME and RetroArch read) presents **zero**
XInput pads, so with emulation running its panel can drive neither path: no
keystrokes, no pad. `screens::footer` says exactly that, in `WARN`, in the one
state where it is true. It used to say "panel: keyboard only" there, which was
the opposite of the truth.

**Two things the cabinet window is not allowed to lie about**, both found by
adversarial review of the first build and both now asserted:

- **Reopening it.** winit permits one event loop per PROCESS
  (`EVENT_LOOP_CREATED`, never reset) and eframe works around that with a
  thread-local it re-enters via `run_app_on_demand`. A window hosted on a fresh
  thread per open therefore worked exactly once per daemon lifetime and then
  failed silently forever — a tray item that stops working with nothing on
  screen saying why, which is this document's "must SAY so" invariant inverted.
  `cabinet::spawn_in_daemon` keeps ONE host thread for the daemon's life and
  re-enters the window on it.
- **Which file the Slots screen writes to.** The list comes from
  `StatusSource::mapper`, which reads `config.toml`'s `[[slot]]` entries when
  there are any and the first games.toml profile otherwise. That is not the
  same answer as `SessionView::profile`, which is whatever `--game` said. The
  picker must write back to the file it READ from
  (`MapperSnapshot::profile`, the machine-readable half of `source`), and where
  the two disagree the screen says so rather than quietly choosing one.

**Every glyph the cabinet draws is ASCII**, or one of two codepoints seen
rendering in a named screenshot. egui's bundled fonts cover a specific set and
nothing warns you when a codepoint is outside it: the first pass shipped
`▲ ▼ Ⓐ Ⓑ` as tofu boxes into the one legend a mouseless surface has, and the
sweep that replaced them missed every string on a path `--demo` cannot reach.
It is a test now (`screens::tests::nothing_this_surface_draws_is_an_unverified_codepoint`),
because a screenshot cannot cover a screen it cannot get to.

## `ksx-api` — the typed surface every front end consumes (2026-08-06)

**One Rust crate holds the control API, and the JSON on the wire is derived
from it at both ends.** `crates/ksx-api` (docs/M9-DECISION.md §6) is what
Studio's server, `ksx session`, the daemon's own pipe reader and the future E5
MCP server all speak. It links `serde`, `thiserror`, `ksx-core` and
`ksx-config` — no axum, no forma, no tokio, no HTTP types, no `async`, not even
behind a feature. A dependency here that could open a socket would undo the M9
decision by accident, so the dependency list is part of the contract.

| module | what it owns |
|---|---|
| `wire` | `Request` / `Response` — one type per verb, and the ONE description of every field on the pipe |
| `control` | `ControlSource`: the write side, with **exactly the tray's reach** — session start/stop/reload, learn, `bind_keys`, restore, clear-all, backups, `save_macro` |
| `status` | `StatusSource`: the read side, satisfiable with **no daemon running** (config store + platform collectors) |
| `machine` | `MachineSource`: devices, presets, autostart, doctor, pads, config/profile operations, and typed `winusb_prepare`/`winusb_release`. `LocalMachine` implements the product calls; trait defaults still refuse safely for partial/test hosts rather than inventing machine state |
| `client` | `VerbSink` → `ControlSource`, so a surface is written once and hosted either way |
| `pipe` | the `\\.\pipe\ksx-daemon` transport |
| `refusal` | `Refusal { code, message, remedy }` |

**Two transports, one trait.** `VerbSink::call(&Request) -> Result<Response,
Refusal>` is the whole seam. `PipeTransport` serializes the request to one JSON
line; a process that HOSTS the supervisor implements the same trait against the
daemon's own dispatch — no line, no parse. That is E7's "no serialization tax,
mapping 1:1 to `DaemonCommand`", kept available as an implementation of a
shared trait rather than as a second copy of every verb: if a native shell is
ever built, it is written against `ControlSource` like everything else and
chooses its sink at construction.

**Refusals are typed, and a refusal owes a way out.** `Refusal.code` is the
same stable word the pipe answers with and the CLI's `--json` prints
(`conflict`, `unknown-preset`, `macro-invalid`, `no-channel`…);
`Refusal.remedy` is the command that works anyway. That field is how the
invariant below — *a surface that cannot act must SAY so, per click* — became a
type obligation instead of a review checklist item. `Display` is the message
alone, so attaching a remedy can never rewrite a sentence a test pinned.

**Why it is the crate and not the page.** The traits lived in `ksx-studio`
while Studio was the only surface that had them, which meant the contract could
not be consumed by a build that excludes Studio — and the default build does
(`--features studio`). `ksx session` performs the same verbs with no HTTP
anywhere. A contract cannot be owned by whichever surface was written first.

### The drift this closes, and the test that keeps it closed

On 2026-08-06 a macro field was dropped in flight: the daemon's `map-macro`
body reader carried an ALLOWLIST of body field names, `repeat` (and its
`turbo_hz`/`gap_ms` rate) was not on it, and a macro card that set `while-held`
saved `once` — under a "saved" toast, because a dropped field looks exactly
like a field nobody set. Two descriptions of one message, 3,000 lines apart,
and nothing that failed when they disagreed.

Both halves are now structural:

- **The body of a `map-macro` request IS `ksx_config::MacroFile`.** There is no
  list of body fields anywhere; a field added to the macro table is on the wire
  the moment it compiles. What remains is the ENVELOPE's closed set (`verb`,
  `preset`, `name`, `delete`, `reload`), and getting THAT wrong is loud —
  `MacroFile` is `deny_unknown_fields`, so a stray envelope key comes back as a
  refusal that names it, never a silent drop.
- **`every_typed_request_is_answered_by_a_response_ksx_api_models_completely`**
  (`ksx-backend/src/daemon/pipe.rs`) walks every verb against the REAL dispatch: it
  serializes the typed request exactly as a client would, hands the line to
  `handle_request`, reads the answer back through the typed response, and fails
  if the daemon said any field the API does not model. Adding a field to a
  daemon answer without adding it to `ksx-api` fails there.

`ksx-studio`'s routes are adapters over this API, and that is the rule that
keeps them adapters: **no route may contain a decision a non-HTTP caller would
have to re-implement.** Violating it is how Studio gets forked.

## Operation → surface map

| Operation | Today's surface | GUI mapping (M9 in-process / M10 ksx-api) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Start emulation | `ksx run` (foreground session); daemon: tray "Start emulation" / headless stdin `start` / pipe `start` / `ksx session start [--game TITLE]` — all → `DaemonCommand::Start` | M9: enqueue `DaemonCommand::Start` on the control loop the UI hosts in-process. **M10: Studio's Start button POSTs `/session/start` → pipe `start` → the same command (live)** | exists — pipe + CLI + Studio live |
| Stop emulation | tray "Stop emulation" / stdin `stop` / pipe `stop` / `ksx session stop` → `DaemonCommand::Stop`; Ctrl+Alt+Del is the capture-thread emergency stop. LeftCtrl ×5 only toggles keyboard capture off/on and deliberately leaves the session running | M9: `DaemonCommand::Stop`. **M10: Studio's Stop button POSTs `/session/stop` → pipe `stop` (live).** Escapes are deliberately NOT a GUI concern — see invariants | exists — pipe + CLI + Studio live |
| Quit daemon | tray "Quit" / stdin `quit` / typed pipe `quit` / `ksx session quit` → `DaemonCommand::Quit`. Pipe success waits for session reap, tray/control-loop join, panel claim release, and closure of current + queued pipe instances; an already absent daemon is success only for this idempotent verb | No Studio route or authored control. The installed uninstaller uses hidden fixed `uninstall-quiesce`: verify protected Program Files self, remove and prove absence of `ksx\autostart`, then perform this bounded Quit handshake before WinUSB cleanup | exists — tray + headless + pipe + CLI; uninstall-internal composition |
| Session status + live health | tray tooltip (`DaemonState::tooltip`: `RunState` + `LiveHealth` while running, `LastSession` after); stdin `status` → `DaemonCommand::Status`; pipe `status` / `ksx session status [--json]` (state + game + profiles + last/live health); `ksx run --latency` for the rolling latency summary | M9: poll the same `SharedState` snapshot (`DaemonState`) the tray polls — small, cloneable, no borrows of anything live. **M10: Studio's session panel renders the pipe `status` response (live)** | exists — pipe + CLI + Studio live |
| Reload config | tray "Reload config" / stdin `reload` / pipe `reload` / `ksx session reload` → `DaemonCommand::Reload` — a clean stop and a clean start from disk. A mapper SAVE takes the narrower `DaemonCommand::ApplyBindings` instead: binding-only edits hot-swap into the live engine with the pads left plugged, structural changes fall back to the same bounce (see "the binding hot-swap") | M9: `DaemonCommand::Reload`. **M10: Studio's Reload button POSTs `/config/reload` → pipe `reload` (live)** | exists — pipe + CLI + Studio live |
| List / identify devices | `ksx devices [--json]` (both backends, read-only); `ksx winusb status [--json]` for the USB/claim view | M9: same enumeration in-process — strictly read-only, safe mid-session. M10: api devices | exists |
| **First-contact setup** | `ksx setup [--slot N] [--preset NAME] [--profile TITLE] [--step-secs N] [--dry-run] [--json]` — the wizard (`ksx-backend/src/setup.rs`): identify the panel by PRESS (Raw Input, the same observer the pipe's `learn-key` uses), then sequential position-named prompts (`SOUTH`, not `A`), auto-advance, inline ALREADY TAKEN, a completeness audit (warns when the panel can reach neither START nor BACK), and a TRANSACTIONAL commit — nothing is written until the review screen is confirmed, and the slot wiring (`config.toml` or a `games.toml` profile) is a separate question it ASKS. Chains P1→P4 in one run. Skipping is "press nothing": each prompt runs a visible countdown, two silent prompts end the run | M9: the same `Wizard` state machine behind a modal — it is deliberately pure (`Input` in, `Reaction` out), so the UI supplies the observer and the printer and decides nothing. M10: needs the live socket to carry presses; the audit and the transaction are already shared | exists — CLI |
| **Preset templates** | `ksx preset list [--templates] [--json]`; `ksx preset new <NAME> --from-template <ID> [--player N] [--force] [--dry-run] [--json]`. Templates ship in code (`ksx-core/src/templates.rs`), beside the `default`/`empty` built-ins they sit with: `arcade-6button` (I-PAC/MAME six-button, P1–P2 blocks), `arcade-4way` (MAME four-player chart, P1–P4), `keyboard-wasd`, `keyboard-2p` (two players on ONE keyboard — WASD against the arrows, P1–P2 blocks), plus `default`/`empty` as named seeds. Instantiating writes an ORDINARY preset (never protected), refuses to clobber without `--force`, and backs up first when it does | M9/M10: a "new preset from…" picker over the same registry — the list and the instantiation are one call each and carry the panel notes with them | exists — CLI |
| Pad test | `ksx pads --count N --persona xbox360\|playstation [--json]` (plug, test pattern, unplug) | M9: same routine in-process, only while emulation is stopped (test pads compete for the four XInput slots). M10: api | exists |
| Per-slot persona | TOML edit: `persona = "playstation"` on the `[[slot]]` (aliases `ds4`/`ps4` accepted) | M7 wizard / mapping verbs first; then GUI forms write the same TOML and issue `Reload` | gap — TOML-only **by design** until M7 |
| Preset editing | `ksx map --preset "Panel P1" --function A --key G [--clear] [--force] [--move-from FUNCTION] [--json]`; **key LISTS: repeat or comma-separate `--key` (`--key S --key Enter`, `--key S,Enter`) → `A = ["S", "Enter"]`, one write** (pipe: `"keys": ["S","Enter"]`, the list spelling of `"key"` — exactly one of the two); chords: `--when B[,C] [--unless K]`; **TURBO: `--turbo-hz N`** (auto-fire while the key is held; `0` = off, omitted = leave the control's existing rate alone, `--clear` clears it with the keys; one rate per CONTROL, so several keys share one clock — docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §3a). The rate is CAPPED, never refused: a press AND a release must each survive a 60 Hz poll, so ~15 Hz is the fastest deliverable and the response carries both `turbo_hz` and `turbo_effective_hz` (pipe `map` takes the same `"turbo_hz"` field); whole-preset: `--restore defaults\|session-backup\|latest-backup`, `--clear-all`, `--list-backups`; macro BODIES: `ksx macro --preset X --name N --from-json FILE` / `--delete` (pipe `map-macro`); pipe `map` / `map-macro` / `map-restore` / `map-clear-all` / `map-backups` (same writers: `ksx-backend/src/mapping.rs`); TOML edit still first-class | **Studio's `/map` mapper (live)**: click a control → pipe `learn-key` → pipe `map` — every write goes through the one shared writer, never a parallel editor. "Add another key" and the per-key ✕ send the control's WHOLE key list (`ControlSource::bind_keys` → one `map` with `"keys"`), so a multi-key edit is ONE atomic write, not read-modify-write. Conflict detection is server-side in that writer (see below). The macro editor reads a preset's `[macros]` tables (`StatusSource::macros`) and saves a whole table back through `/api/macro/save` → `ControlSource::save_macro` → pipe `map-macro` — including `repeat` / `turbo_hz` / `gap_ms`, with the effective-rate math printed live beside the selector. PER-BINDING TURBO shows on each legend row as its EFFECTIVE rate and is set from the learn dialog ("Set turbo" / "No turbo", beside Replace / Add another key / Clear) or, with no JavaScript, the row form's `turbo_hz` box and `Turbo` submit → `POST /map/turbo`; both write through the same `ControlSource::bind_keys` with the control's current key list, so turbo is never a second writer. Studio does not yet DISPLAY chords (later pass) — the CLI/pipe author them and the engine runs them | exists — CLI + pipe + Studio live |
| Learn a key ("press the panel key for P1·A") | pipe `learn-key` / `learn-poll` / `learn-cancel` (asynchronous; see "learn-key semantics" below) | **Studio's mapper drives it (live)**: `/api/learn*` → the pipe verbs. No CLI face yet (`ksx map` takes the key by name; `ksx monitor` shows names) | exists — pipe + Studio |
| Game profiles | TOML edit (`games.toml`); consumed by `ksx run --game`, `ksx daemon --game`, `ksx autostart --game` | Editing: M7 verbs (E5 `ksx slot assign` family), then GUI forms over them. Consuming: `DaemonCommand`/api as above. **The cabinet's "Game" screen picks one and starts it** — one `start` with a profile title, never a new path | gap for AUTHORING a profile; consuming and picking exist |
| **Which preset a slot uses** | `ksx slot list [--profile TITLE]` (read-only, daemon-free); `ksx slot assign --slot N --preset NAME [--profile TITLE] [--reload] [--json]`; pipe `slot-assign`; writer `ksx-backend/src/slots.rs` | **The cabinet's "Slots" screen** — pick a slot, pick a preset, confirm the pad bounce. `ControlSource::assign_slot` → the same verb. **Studio's `/setup` step 2 (live)**: `POST /setup/slot` → the same `assign_slot`, with the pad bounce stated above the button rather than flashed after it | exists — CLI + pipe + cabinet + Studio |
| **Watch a running pipeline** (button check) | none — this is live data, not a verb | **The cabinet's "Buttons" screen**, over the lossy fan-out sink (`ksx-backend/src/feed.rs`, shape in `ksx-api::live`): what the PANEL sent beside what the PAD published, per slot. Read-only by construction — the sink has no write path at all | exists — cabinet (in-daemon only; there is no wire protocol for the stream yet, and `ksx cabinet` as a separate process says so instead of rendering a dead panel) |
| WinUSB claim / release / status | Advanced CLI: `ksx winusb status` is read-only; legacy operator `claim`/`release` remain explicit. Supported customer mutation requires an installed build | **Studio `/start` is primary and installed-only**: exact selected selector+instance, three prepare confirmations (tested spare, rebind consequence, machine-local certificate), one release confirmation, UAC through the fixed GUI helper, fresh exact re-survey, then guarded backend transition. Portable copies refuse preparation/release | exists — CLI status + typed MachineSource + Studio |
| Autostart | `ksx autostart --enable/--disable/--status` (validates the config before registering); hidden installed `uninstall-quiesce` removes only fixed `ksx\autostart` and freshly proves it absent | M9: same verb in-process. M10: api | exists |
| Install ViGEmBus | `ksx install-drivers [--dry-run] [--yes]` — SealedFile pins; this verb never self-elevates | Installer checkbox is primary; Studio reports pad-bus state but cannot run this general installer. WinUSB's fixed exact-device helper is a separate capability/consent boundary, not this row | exists |
| Export config as JSON | `ksx config export [--what config\|games\|presets\|all] [--preset NAME] [--out PATH\|-] [--compact] [--json]` — the document on stdout (so it pipes), the summary on stderr | M9: same verb in-process; the document IS the payload a form would populate. M10: **live** — `MachineSource::config_export` returns the document IN MEMORY (no path, no stdout), and Studio's `/setup` serves it as a download from `GET /setup/export.json` | exists — CLI + api + Studio |
| Import config from JSON | `ksx config import <PATH\|-> [--what …] [--dry-run] [--yes] [--force] [--json]` — validated first, DRY RUN unless `--yes`, timestamped `.bak` of every overwritten file | M9: same verb, preserving dry-run-first. M10: **live and local only** — `MachineSource::config_import` takes the DOCUMENT, not a path, and keeps the CLI's consent shape exactly (`apply` is what writes; without it the answer is a report). Studio's `/setup` posts it at `POST /setup/import`. Still loopback-only: a REMOTE surface that can replace the whole config wants the pairing token first | exists — CLI + api + Studio |
| Doctor | `ksx doctor [--latency] [--json]` — stable codes, `{report, advice}` | M9: same verb, render the JSON. M10: api | exists |

## Config interop: TOML is canonical, JSON is for machines (2026-08-06)

`ksx config export|import` (`ksx-backend/src/config_io.rs`, over
`ksx-config/src/interop.rs`). Both formats go through the **same serde types**,
so there is no second schema to drift: a field added to a config type is in
both the moment it compiles. `[macros.<name>]` landed while this was being
written and cost the interop layer zero lines.

**Why TOML stayed canonical: comments.** ksx config files are annotated —
`mouse_move_deadzone = 5  # 0..12`, why a cabinet's `launcher_grace_ms` is
20 s, which panel a `[[device]]` id belongs to. Those notes are the difference
between a file that is maintainable a year later and one nobody dares touch,
and they matter just as much to an AI reading the config, which gets the
*intent* next to the value instead of having to infer it. JSON has no syntax
that could keep them, so a JSON-canonical ksx would discard the annotations on
every write. Nothing else came close as an argument.

**Why JSON exists anyway: the readers that are not people.** Preset sharing
(M7), AI-generated configs (E5 — "write me a cabinet config" is the workflow
this verb makes real), and anything that wants a schema.

```
ksx config export                                  # whole root, pretty, stdout
ksx config export --preset "Panel P1" --out p1.json # one preset, shareable
ksx config export --what games --compact | jq .    # stdout is ONLY the document
ksx config import cabinet.json                     # DRY RUN — validated report
ksx config import cabinet.json --yes               # writes, .bak first
cat p1.json | ksx config import - --what presets --yes
```

| rule | why |
|---|---|
| **The document goes to stdout; the summary goes to stderr** (human, or one JSON object with `--json`) | `ksx config export > cabinet.json` and `\| jq` both work with no flag juggling |
| **Import is a DRY RUN unless `--yes`** (`--dry-run` is the explicit spelling and wins over `--yes`) | the same dry-run/apply convention as other file-writing CLI verbs. Installed WinUSB preparation is intentionally stronger: three separately named safety confirmations plus UAC, not a generic `--yes` |
| **Validated before anything is written**, against the configuration the import WOULD PRODUCE (imported presets layered over the ones on disk), through the same `ksx-config::validate` the run plan uses. Any non-advisory finding refuses, structurally (`issues[]`), with nothing written; `--force` writes anyway | a config that fails to resolve is a cabinet that boots to nothing |
| **Every overwritten file is copied to `<file>.bak-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` first** (`-2`, `-3`… inside one second), the same convention and name shape the mapper uses, so `ksx map --list-backups` finds them | imports rewrite whole files; comments do not survive, so the road back has to exist |
| **What lands on disk is canonical TOML**, unless the target file is already a `.json` | JSON is the transport, not the storage |
| **A bare document must say what it is.** An enveloped document carries `ksx_interop` and describes itself; a bare `ConfigFile`/`GamesFile`/`PresetFile`/preset-array (what an assistant usually writes) needs `--what` to name its type | a preset and a games file are both just objects; importing the wrong file over the wrong file is the failure this verb exists to prevent, so it refuses rather than sniffs |

**The store reads `.json` too.** `config.json` / `games.json` /
`presets\<name>.json` are loaded when no TOML of that name exists, and a file
is saved back in the format it already had. **Where both spellings exist the
TOML wins and the JSON is ignored**, with a warning naming the ignored file —
never a merge. A merge would need a conflict rule per field, and the first time
it guessed wrong it would guess wrong silently, on a file the user believed was
authoritative. One winner, said out loud.

**The one thing JSON does not get is migration.** The store's migration steps
operate on a raw `toml::Table` because the canonical file is the one that has
to survive upgrades; a `.json` config at another `schema_version` is refused,
not migrated (convert → let ksx migrate the TOML → export again). Costs nothing
today — v1 is the first schema and the registry is empty — and is written down
so it cannot surprise anyone later.

Refusal codes (`--json` `code`, stable, exit 2 with nothing written):
`untagged-json`, `unsupported-interop`, `unsupported-schema`, `bad-json`,
`empty-selection`, `bad-selection`, `unknown-preset`, `validation-failed`.
Exit 3 means some files were written and then a write failed — the report names
both halves.

## The daemon control channel (M10a first slice — CLOSED the old gap 1)

A running daemon now serves `\\.\pipe\ksx-daemon` (`ksx-backend/src/daemon/pipe.rs`).
Formerly: "a RUNNING daemon has no external control channel" — `DaemonCommand`'s
only senders were the tray thread and the headless stdin reader. The pipe is the
third front end with **exactly the tray's reach**: it enqueues the same
`DaemonCommand` values the tray menu produces onto the same crossbeam channel,
reads the same `DaemonState` snapshot the tray polls, and reads games.toml from
disk. It has no path to the factory, the panel, or any pipeline thread, and it
runs on one plain thread — no async runtime, so E7 rule A (default build links
no tokio/axum/forma) still holds.

**Protocol** — one JSON request line in, one JSON response line out, per
connection; then the server disconnects. Kept deliberately dumb.

```
→ {"verb":"status"}
← {"ok":true,"run":"running","slots":4,"message":null,"game":"Example Game",
   "tooltip":"ksx — running, 4 pad(s)\ngame: Example Game",
   "profiles":[{"title":"Example Game","detail":"C:\\games\\example-game.exe — 2 slots"}],
   "last":null,"live":{"reboot_required":false,"watchdog_tripped":false,"dropped_events":0}}

→ {"verb":"start","profile":"Example Game"}     ("profile" optional)
← {"ok":true,"message":"running (4 slot(s))"}
← {"ok":false,"error":"already running"}           (refusal example)

→ {"verb":"stop"}
← {"ok":true,"message":"stopped"}                  (or {"ok":false,"error":"not running"})

→ {"verb":"reload"}
← {"ok":true,"message":"running (4 slot(s))"}
```

The M7 mapper slice adds four verbs on the same channel:

```
→ {"verb":"map","preset":"Panel P1","function":"A","key":"G",
   "force":false,"reload":true}          ("clear":true instead of "key" unbinds)
← {"ok":true,"message":"\"Panel P1\": A = G — the next session start reads it",
   "path":"C:\\…\\presets\\Panel P1.toml","preset":"Panel P1","function":"A",
   "key":"G","keys":["G"],"when":[],"unless":[],"also_drives":[],
   "moved_from":null,"conflicts":[],"flash":[],"reloaded":false}

→ {"verb":"map","preset":"Panel P1","function":"A","keys":["S","Enter"]}
← {"ok":true,"message":"\"Panel P1\": A = S, Enter — …", …,

### Which preset a slot uses: `slot-assign` (2026-08-06)

The one write verb on this channel that is **not** a preset edit, and the one
whose `reload` is a BOUNCE (honest gaps 1 and 5, above).

```
→ {"verb":"slot-assign","slot":3,"preset":"Panel P3","profile":"Example Launcher","reload":true}
← {"ok":true,
   "message":"slot 3 in profile \"Example Launcher\": \"Player 3\" → \"Panel P3\" — a slot
              change needs the pads replugged — running (4 slot(s))",
   "path":"C:\\…\\games.toml","slot":3,"preset":"Panel P3",
   "previous_preset":"Player 3","profile":"Example Launcher","created":false,
   "unchanged":false,
   "backup":{"stamp":"20260806-184011","label":"20260806-184011","path":"…"},
   "restarted":true,"reloaded":true}

→ {"verb":"slot-assign","slot":1,"preset":"Nope"}
← {"ok":false,"code":"unknown-preset",
   "error":"no preset called \"Nope\" — presets on disk: Panel P1, Panel P2"}
```

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `profile` | absent = `config.toml`'s `[[slot]]` list; present = that games.toml profile. The same either/or `ksx setup` asks about |
| `previous_preset` | what the slot pointed at BEFORE — `null` when the slot was created. A surface must be able to say "P3: Player 3 → Panel P3", not only the new half |
| `unchanged` | the slot already used that preset. `ok: true`, nothing written, no backup, and the message says "already" so nobody waits for a bounce that is not coming |
| `restarted` | a running session was bounced. **There is no `hot_swap` field on this verb**, deliberately: see gap 5 |
| `backup` | the timestamped copy of the whole file, taken before the write, exactly like every whole-preset write |

Refusal codes: `unknown-preset` (lists the ones on disk), `unknown-profile`
(lists the titles), `bad-slot` (outside 1..=`ksx_core::MAX_SLOTS`, 16 today —
the refusal text is formatted from the constant, so it always names the real
bound), `config-error`. Every one of them refuses **before** anything is copied
or written, so a refusal never leaves a stray backup behind.

`map-restore` (writer: `mapping.rs::restore`; CLI face: `ksx map --preset …
--restore defaults|session-backup|latest-backup`) has **three destinations**,
and every surface must name the destination rather than the word "restore":

| mode | writes | undoes |
|---|---|---|
| `defaults` | the **generic keyboard layout** — `ksx_core::Preset::builtin_default()`: S=A, D=B, A=X, W=Y, Q/E triggers, arrow keys = left stick, Esc=Start, Backspace=Back. Keeps the preset's NAME | nothing — it is the always-there floor |
| `session-backup` | the preset as it was before the daemon's FIRST `map` write of this daemon lifetime (`<preset>.toml.session-bak`; `pipe.rs::map_fn` owns the once-per-lifetime set) | everything mapped since the daemon started |
| `latest-backup` | the preset as it was before the most recent whole-preset write (the newest `<preset>.toml.bak-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`) | the previous restore, or a clear-all |

**`defaults` is the one that surprises people, and the labels exist to stop
it.** It does NOT mean "this preset as it shipped" — on an arcade cabinet it
replaces an I-PAC panel map with a desktop-keyboard map. Studio's button
therefore reads "Reset to generic keyboard layout (S/D/A/W…)", `--help` spells
the layout out, and the confirm dialog names every key it writes. The abstract
phrase "restore defaults" appears nowhere in the UI any more.

**Every whole-preset write takes a timestamped backup first** — restore ×3 and
`map-clear-all` alike. The current file is copied to
`<preset>.toml.bak-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` (UTC, sortable; a second write inside the
same second gets `-2`, `-3`…) BEFORE the new content is written, and only once
the replacement has been read and validated — so a refusal leaves no stray
backup. Backups are never pruned: they are small, restores are rare and
deliberate, and deleting a cabinet's only copy of a panel map to save kilobytes
is not a trade ksx makes. The response's `backup` field, `ksx map
--list-backups --preset X [--json]` and the pipe's `map-backups` all read the
same list, newest first; Studio labels its third button with the newest
timestamp ("Restore backup from 2026-08-05 14:32:07 UTC") and HIDES the button
when there is none, because offering a road home that does not exist is worse
than not offering one.

`map-clear-all` (writer: `mapping.rs::clear_all`; CLI face: `ksx map --preset …
--clear-all`) unbinds every function while keeping the file structurally valid:
it writes the `empty` built-in's SHAPE — all 25 functions present, each keyed
`"None"` — the same convention single-function `--clear` uses, so a cleared
control stays visible in the legend instead of vanishing.

Refusal codes (`--json` `code`, stable): `unknown-preset`, `unknown-function`,
`unknown-macro`, `unknown-key`, `invalid-guard`, `bad-move-from`, `conflict`
(cross-slot only), `no-session-backup`, `no-backup`, `bad-backup`,
`config-error`. A corrupt backup is refused, never written.

### Macros: `--function macro.<name>` (2026-08-05)

```
ksx map --preset "Panel P1" --function macro.hadouken --key P    # bind the trigger
ksx map --preset "Panel P1" --function macro.hadouken --clear    # unbind it
```

`ksx map` binds the key that **starts** a macro; cross-slot conflicts,
`--force` and the `also_drives` multi-bind report behave exactly as they do for
a pad function. `--when`/`--unless` and `--move-from` are refused with a reason
(`invalid-guard` / `bad-move-from`), and a name with no `[macros.<name>]` table
behind it gives `unknown-macro` listing the macros the preset does have.

`ksx run --dry-run` prints every configured macro (steps, total ms,
`on_release`/`retrigger`/`interrupt`, and the keys that start it) in both human
and `--json` form. See docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §1c.

### Macro BODIES: `ksx macro` / pipe `map-macro` (2026-08-06)

The sequence itself, as a WHOLE table — one more surface on the same writer
(`mapping.rs::save_macro`), never a second editor:

```
ksx macro --preset "Panel P1" --name hadouken --from-json hadouken.json
ksx macro --preset "Panel P1" --name hadouken --delete
echo '{"steps":[{"hold":["A"],"ms":50}]}' | ksx macro --preset "Panel P1" --name jab

→ {"verb":"map-macro","preset":"Panel P1","name":"hadouken",
   "steps":[{"hold":["dpad.down"],"ms":50},{"hold":["A"],"frames":3}],
   "on_release":"finish","retrigger":"ignore","interrupt":"none","reload":true}
← {"ok":true,"message":"…","path":"…","preset":"Panel P1","name":"hadouken",
   "steps":2,"total_ms":83,"deleted":false,"triggers":["P"],"warnings":[],
   "backup":{"stamp":"…","label":"…","path":"…"},
   "reloaded":true,"hot_swap":true}
```

- **The body is JSON on stdin or `--from-json FILE`**, and its field names ARE
  `ksx_config::MacroFile`'s — the preset file's own serde types, not a parallel
  schema. A duration authored in `frames` survives as frames. A flag-per-field
  CLI for a timeline would be worse than the TOML it writes; this way an editor
  round-trips what it was shown.
- **WHOLE-MACRO, never per-step.** The editor holds the entire grid, so it can
  always send all of it; a per-step protocol would carry indices computed
  against a file that may have moved, and one dropped message would leave a
  sequence nobody authored. Bindings, chords and the preset's other macros are
  untouched.
- **Validated before the write**, through `ksx_config::validate` — the rules
  `ksx doctor` reports for a hand-edited file. Unknown functions in a `hold`
  set, no steps, a step with two duration units or none are REFUSED
  (`macro-invalid`, with a `problems` row each); a step below the sampling
  floor is an ADVISORY and comes back in `warnings`, never swallowed.
- **`--delete` is an explicit word**, and it takes the `macro.<name>` trigger
  rows with it (a trigger whose table is gone does not load at all). An empty
  step list is a refusal, so a tool that lost its draft cannot delete a macro
  by omission.
- **A timestamped backup first**, exactly like `map-restore` / `map-clear-all`
  — so `ksx map --restore latest-backup` is the undo for a macro edit too.
- **`"reload":true` hot-swaps.** A macro body is a BINDING change: it moves no
  slot, persona, device or capture backend, so `SessionShape::bounce_reason`
  finds nothing and the live engine takes it with the pads left plugged (see
  the hot-swap section below). Studio's macro editor posts `/api/macro/save`
  → `ControlSource::save_macro` → this verb.

### Chords: `--when` / `--unless` (2026-08-06)

```
ksx map --preset "Panel P1" --function rt --key D --when F
ksx map --preset "Panel P1" --function lb --key D --when F,C --unless LeftShift
ksx map --preset "Panel P1" --function rt --clear      # removes the chord too
```

`--when KEYS` / `--unless KEYS` (comma-separated, or repeated) turn the write
into a GUARDED binding — a chord: "this function, but only while these other
keys are (not) also held". Pipe equivalent: `"when":["F"]`, `"unless":[…]`;
both absent from a plain write, so every pre-chord caller is unchanged. They
belong to the BIND action only — clap refuses them alongside `--clear`,
`--restore` or `--clear-all`. `--clear` and any re-map of the same function
remove that function's chord as well as its plain keys (replace-per-function
covers guarded rows), so a cleared control is really cleared. The full
semantics — consumption, specificity, releases — are
docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §1b.

Two deliberate differences from a plain bind, both about not lying:

- **A chord never conflicts.** Layering `rt = D+F` over keys that already do
  something is the whole point, so the conflict gate is skipped and nothing
  is ever stolen from the bindings the chord sits on top of.
- **It reports the flash instead.** `flash` is `[{"key":"G","bound_to":"A"}]`
  for every constituent that is ALSO bound on its own, and the human message
  spells out what the player will see: ksx does not defer input, so pressing
  that key first shows its own output for a moment before the chord takes
  over. Empty `flash` = the recommended shape (dedicated chord keys, no cost
  at all). The same finding appears as a `[WARN]` in the run plan; it is
  advice, not a refusal.

`invalid-guard` (exit 2, nothing written) covers the guards that cannot mean
anything: the trigger key listed in its own `--when`/`--unless`, a key in both
lists, or a guard with no `--key`. Unknown guard key names are `unknown-key`,
like any other key name. `ksx doctor`-style config validation additionally
refuses **ambiguous equal-specificity chords** — two guards of the same size
on the same trigger that could be satisfied together — at session start, so
which one wins is never a build-order accident.

`map` writes through the SAME `ksx-backend/src/mapping.rs::apply` the CLI verb
uses — replace-per-function, `"None"` placeholder on clear, canonical TOML
rewrite (comments do not survive; the store's atomic-write trade), CONFLICT
DETECTION server-side in the writer.

### Key lists: many keys, one control (2026-08-06)

**A control can be given its WHOLE key list in one `map` write** — the OR-chain
the engine has always executed (`A = ["S", "Enter"]`, press either;
docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §1a). `"keys": ["S","Enter"]` on the pipe verb,
`--key S --key Enter` (or `--key S,Enter`) on the CLI.

| rule | what happens |
|---|---|
| `"key"` vs `"keys"` | two spellings of ONE field. `"key"` is the one-key form; **both in one request is refused** (`key-and-keys`, exit 2, nothing written) rather than merged — honouring both would mean ignoring one |
| ordering | the caller's order is kept verbatim, and that is the order the file holds (`A = ["S", "Enter"]`) — the mapper's tags read the way the player built them |
| duplicates | dropped, FIRST occurrence wins, compared AFTER the key name is resolved (`--key s --key S` is one key). The file never holds the same key twice for one control |
| still replace-per-function | the list REPLACES what that control held (an empty list is a `--clear`, leaving the inert `"None"`). So "add another key" is *old keys + new one* and the per-key ✕ is *old keys − that one*: Studio computes the set and sends it whole, which makes each edit ONE atomic write instead of read-modify-write |
| response | `"keys"` is the resulting list; `"key"` stays the FIRST key (`null` for a clear) so every pre-list reader is unaffected |
| conflicts | checked per key, in order: the first cross-slot conflict refuses the WHOLE write (nothing is written for any key). `--force` writes and reports every overridden key by name |
| chords | untouched — a guarded binding lives in its own row (`Preset::chords`), so a key list on one control and a chord on another coexist in the same file. A chord is ONE trigger key, so `--when`/`--unless` with a list is refused (`invalid-guard`), as is `--move-from` with a list (`bad-move-from`: it takes ONE key away from ONE control) |

### Multi-bind: one key, many controls (2026-08-06)

**A key already used by another control of the SAME preset is not a conflict —
it is a multi-bind, and it is written.** The engine has no uniqueness
constraint in either direction ("many keys → one function and one key → many
functions are both native", `ksx-core/src/preset.rs`,
docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §1a): one key compiles to a `SmallVec` of targets and
they all fire together. So the write leaves every other control holding that
key exactly as it was and REPORTS them:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `also_drives` | the other functions of THIS preset the key drives now that the write is done, sorted. Information, never a refusal (`["A","B"]`). Empty for a clear, for a chord, and for an exclusive key. Studio shows the same fact as the legend's "also A · B" badges, which `render_map.rs::shared_labels` re-derives from disk |
| `moved_from` | `null` unless `"move_from"` was asked for; otherwise `{"function":"A","remaining":[],"unbound":true}` — the ONE control the key was taken from, what it kept, and whether it is now unbound |

That is what makes the mapper's **"Map all to one key"** work: it is N ordinary
`map` calls with one key, and all N stick (MAPPER-UX commandment 7 —
duplicates are information, fan-out is the product). Re-binding one control
still replaces only that control's keys; its co-binders keep theirs.

**`"move_from":"A"` (CLI `--move-from A`) is the explicit hand-over**, and the
only way this verb unbinds something it was not asked to bind: it takes THIS
key off THAT one function (which keeps the inert `"None"` if that emptied it,
and keeps its other keys if it had more) and touches nothing else. Never
implicit, never a side effect of `force`. It is refused — before any write —
if it names the function being bound, a function that does not hold that key
(the refusal says what that control actually has), a clear, or a chord:
`bad-move-from`, exit 2.

**The one conflict left is CROSS-SLOT, and it still blocks**: the key bound in
another slot's preset, within a slot list that also uses the target preset.
**A machine has two slot lists and both are searched** — config.toml's
`[[slot]]` table (`"scope":"config"`, the panel whenever no profile was
chosen) and each games.toml profile (`"scope":"profile"`). Every row carries
`file`, the file name as the daemon RESOLVED it (`config.toml`, `games.toml`,
or the portable/interop spelling of either), because "another slot" is not an
address a user can act on; a row from an old daemon has no `file` and the line
degrades to what it always said. That preset is **never auto-edited** —
`force` writes the target anyway and keeps reporting the double binding;
silently rewriting a preset the caller did not name would be worse. So `force`
means exactly one thing — "yes, both slots should see that key" — and it
**removes no binding, anywhere, ever**. The genuinely destructive writes are
their own verbs (`map-restore`, `map-clear-all`), each taking a timestamped
backup first.

### `"reload":true` — the binding hot-swap (2026-08-05)

Every write verb (`map`, `map-macro`, `map-restore`, `map-clear-all`) takes the
same optional `"reload":true`. It used to mean `DaemonCommand::Reload`: a clean
stop, re-read, start — which unplugged four pads, made Windows play its
disconnect/reconnect chime, made Steam re-enumerate, and made a game in
progress see its controllers vanish. The product question, verbatim: "why does it
need to disconnect to reconnect?"

It now enqueues `DaemonCommand::ApplyBindings`, and the control loop picks the
cheapest correct answer:

| change | what happens |
|---|---|
| preset CONTENTS, or a slot pointing at a different preset | **hot swap**: `ksx-core`'s `EngineTables` are rebuilt on the daemon's control thread and moved into the live engine (`Engine::swap_tables`). Pads stay plugged, keyboards stay captured, nothing re-enumerates. Response: `"hot_swap":true`, message "bindings applied live — pads untouched" |
| slot count, slot numbering, persona, keyboard/mouse assignment, blocking policy, capture backend | **bounce**: exactly the old `Reload`, and the message names what changed ("session restarted — slot 3 changed persona … needs the pads replugged"). Response: `"hot_swap":false` |
| the config no longer resolves | nothing is torn down. Tearing a working session down to fail the restart is the worst of both; the response says the session is still running on its old bindings |
| nothing running | nothing to do — the next start reads the file |

The split is drawn where the DRIVERS are: anything that would make the output
thread plug a different pad, or the capture thread block a different device,
takes a real teardown (`run/supervisor.rs::SessionShape::bounce_reason` is the
one place that rule lives). Everything else is a key→function table.

**Hot-path purity is preserved**: the new tables are built off-thread (the
control loop may block and allocate freely) and the engine thread only moves
pointers. **Stuck keys are impossible**: dense key ids belong to the old
tables, so `swap_tables` re-baselines the key state and RETURNS the neutral
states of any control that was held across the edit — the supervisor forwards
them, so a rebind can never strand a pressed virtual button.

The config invariant below is unchanged in substance: config still lives in
hand-editable TOML, changes still land by re-reading that TOML, and there is
still no parallel binary store or GUI-only state. What changed is that a
BINDING-ONLY re-read no longer requires destroying and rebuilding the driver
objects around it.

`ksx session reload` and the tray's "Reload config" keep the blunt
stop-and-start semantics — they exist for "restart whatever changed".

**learn-key semantics** (the honest v1): the daemon observes the next key
press via a Raw Input sink (`ksx-capture::observe_next_key` — instance path +
the same corrected `Key` vocabulary presets store; injected input is ignored
by construction). Because a running session's captured keyboards are
suppressed below win32k — where a Raw Input sink hears nothing — `learn-key`
is **refused while a session is running** instead of timing out silently.

That refusal was re-examined in full on 2026-08-05 (a live session had the operator
clicking a mapper that answered nothing) and deliberately KEPT, because ksx
could obviously tap its own capture stream instead and must not:

1. the capture thread is the one thread on this machine where a bug freezes
   every keyboard until reboot. It is time-critical, allocation-free and
   lock-free on purpose; a convenience feature does not get a code path in it;
2. a key pressed to be LEARNED would also fire its current binding, on every
   slot it fans out to — mapping would inject real gameplay input;
3. rebinding a key while it is physically held could leave a virtual button
   pressed under the old binding and released under the new one: exactly the
   stuck-key class the all-keys-up rule and `swap_tables`' release-on-swap
   exist to prevent;
4. mapping is a between-games activity in every tool in the field study
   (MAME's TAB menu pauses the machine; RetroArch binds from its menu).

What changed instead is the UX around the refusal: Studio's mapper renders the
running state as a banner with a **"Pause emulation & map"** button (the plain
`stop` verb), then a persistent **"Resume emulation"** (the `start` verb with
the profile it remembered), with a "paused for mapping" pill in the header so
nobody walks away from a cabinet they stopped. One click each way, no tray
hunt, no CLI — and the `ksx map` fallback is still printed. Same honest
limit for WinUSB-claimed interfaces: a claimed panel is not in the keyboard
stack, so Raw Input cannot hear it even between sessions (its typethrough
injection is deliberately filtered as injected input) — learning from a
claimed panel through the daemon's own report stream is the M8-adjacent
follow-up. Constants are PadForge's earned recorder numbers
(docs/research/padforge-code-audit.md §1.2): 10 s timeout, 33 ms observer
slices, wait-for-release re-baselining (keys held at learn start are ignored
until released — autorepeat cannot steal a chained learn). The verb is
asynchronous by design: the pipe serves clients sequentially, so `learn-key`
only STARTS the observation and returns; `learn-poll` carries the outcome
plus `remaining_ms` — the visible countdown PadForge never had. A second
`learn-key` supersedes the first; `learn-cancel` stops within one slice.

Action verbs poll the snapshot up to 5 s for the outcome; an unsettled command
answers `ok:true` with a "requested — check `ksx session status`" message
rather than guessing. `start`'s profile title is validated by the daemon's
normal plan resolution (the same path a tray Start takes); an unknown title
comes back as the resolver's error and the previously configured profile is
restored. `quit` is the stricter exception: it cannot answer success at the
enqueue point. Daemon main first joins the control loop/tray and releases the
panel claim, then the server flushes the reply, drops both current and
pre-created next instances, and the CLI proves the pipe name absent. Each wait
is bounded; timeout is exit 1, never a cheerful partial success. `config`
remains unavailable on this pipe (meaningless off-machine).

**Trust model**: the pipe has an explicit protected DACL granting full control
only to its object owner (the account that launched the daemon), SYSTEM, and
Administrators. That lets a different credentialed administrator run the
uninstaller for a standard user; unrelated low-privilege users have no ACE and
cannot send mutations. No caller token/path crosses the pipe, and
localhost-only Studio keeps it off the network.

**Concurrency**: one server thread, sequential connections. The next pipe
instance is created before the current connection is served, so a second
client (two Studios, a racing `ksx session`) queues instead of failing;
clients also retry briefly on `ERROR_PIPE_BUSY` / `FILE_NOT_FOUND`. A daemon
that is not running fails the connect cleanly → `ksx session` exit 2; Studio
renders the controls disabled with the reason. A daemon **older than the
pipe** looks identical to "not running" on this surface — the process-list
row on the Studio page is what catches that case.

**Clients**: `ksx session status|start [--game TITLE]|stop|reload|quit` (`--json`
prints the raw response; exit 0 = done, 1 = daemon refused / pipe error,
2 = no control channel; initially absent is exit 0 for `quit` alone) and
Studio's session panel (below). The E5 MCP shim gets the same channel for free.

## The honest gaps

1. ~~No non-interactive mapping verbs yet.~~ **CLOSED (M7 slice, 2026-08-05)**:
   `ksx map` + pipe `map`/`learn-*` + Studio's `/map` mapper, all over one
   writer. ~~Still open from the E5 family: `ksx slot assign`.~~ **CLOSED
   (2026-08-06)**: `ksx slot list|assign` + pipe `slot-assign` +
   `ControlSource::assign_slot`, over one writer (`ksx-backend/src/slots.rs`). The
   remaining half of that E5 item — wiring a DEVICE to a slot — stays with `ksx
   setup`, which identifies the board by PRESS; a preset name cannot imply
   which physical board is in front of the player.
2. **Per-slot persona is a TOML edit today.** Deliberate until the M7 wizard:
   the hand-editable config *is* the interface, and it round-trips.
3. **learn-key cannot hear a WinUSB-claimed panel** (see semantics above) —
   Interception-backed cabinets learn fine; a migrated cabinet uses `ksx map`
   until the claimed-panel learner lands.
4. **learn-key still needs emulation stopped** — deliberately, for the four
   reasons in "learn-key semantics". Studio makes obeying it one click
   (Pause → map → Resume) rather than a dead end.
5. ~~**`ksx slot assign` (which preset a slot uses) is still a TOML edit.**~~
   **CLOSED (2026-08-06).** The whole-file road (`ksx config export --what
   config`, edit, `ksx config import --yes`) still works and is still the right
   tool for a bulk change — but it rewrites the file and **loses every
   comment**, which is exactly the loss the TOML-is-canonical decision exists to
   prevent. `ksx slot assign --slot N --preset NAME [--profile TITLE]` writes
   one field, after a timestamped backup.

   **It BOUNCES, and every surface says so before it is used.** The note this
   entry used to carry — that the change is hot at the engine level, because
   `SessionShape` deliberately leaves `SlotSpec::preset` outside the shape — is
   still true, and the verb deliberately does not take that road. It writes the
   slot ENTRY, whose other fields (keyboard, persona) are genuinely structural,
   and a verb whose pad behaviour depended on which field you happened to change
   is a verb nobody can predict. So `--reload` is `DaemonCommand::Reload`, the
   response carries `restarted` and never `hot_swap`, and the cabinet's confirm
   dialog spells it out: *"the session RESTARTS: all four pads unplug and plug
   back in."* One answer, stated up front, beats a cheaper one that is only
   sometimes true. (`ksx_api::SlotOutcome::restarted` carries the full
   reasoning; flipping it to `ApplyBindings` is a one-line change if the trade
   is ever re-decided.)

   **And it reports what happened, not what was asked.** The response's
   `reloaded` is documented as "`reload` was asked for and the daemon acted on
   it"; the first build echoed the REQUEST instead, so a running session that
   was told to restart and did not come back answered `restarted: false,
   reloaded: true` — which `SlotOutcome::headline` rendered as *"nothing was
   running, so nothing had to restart"* at somebody whose four pads had just
   vanished. `reloaded` is now the daemon's own verdict, and `headline()`
   prints the daemon's sentence (which already carries the failure) in
   preference to re-deriving one from flags. Pinned by
   `pipe::tests::a_slot_assign_whose_restart_fails_says_so_and_never_claims_
   nothing_was_running`.

## Invariants a GUI must not break

Each one protects a measured constraint
(`ARCHITECTURE.md` rules 1–5, `ENHANCEMENTS.md` E7 "enhance, never compromise"):

- **Never touch pipeline threads.** The tray can only enqueue a
  `DaemonCommand`; the pipe thread, the cabinet window and Studio get
  exactly the same reach and no more. Live data flows out through snapshots (`DaemonState`,
  `HealthSlot`) or a lossy fan-out sink — a slow or wedged UI can cost a
  window, never a keyboard.
- **The live fan-out is a LOSSY QUEUE, never a callback, and it costs nothing
  when nobody is watching.** `ksx-backend/src/feed.rs` is the one stream a surface
  sees a running pipeline through, and it has three properties that are
  structural rather than promised:
  1. **the gate** — every publish begins with one `Relaxed` load of a
     subscriber count and returns. With no window open (the normal state of a
     cabinet) the engine and output threads run exactly the pipeline they ran
     before the sink existed;
  2. **bounded and lossy** — delivery is `try_send` on a bounded channel. Full
     means the event is dropped and a counter moves, and that counter is
     reported to the consumer in its next frame, so loss is visible rather than
     silent. A slow consumer can never backpressure the engine;
  3. **no closure anywhere** — the sink holds `Sender`s, not callbacks. Nothing
     a surface writes can execute on a pipeline thread. A wedged UI wedges
     itself.
  **Coalescing is the CONSUMER's job**, at display rate (~60 Hz): the producer
  publishes every transition and `LiveSubscription::poll` folds whatever
  arrived into one `ksx_api::LiveFrame`. Sampling at 60 Hz instead would drop a
  button tap shorter than 16 ms — so every intermediate state is folded into
  `SlotLive::hit`, and a 4 ms tap is invisible in `down` and unmistakable in
  `hit`. That is the property the button check rests on. One stream, three
  consumers by design (docs/MAPPER-UX.md Build C, docs/ENHANCEMENTS.md E8's
  feedback bus, and Studio's `/check` — SHIPPED 2026-08-08); the shape lives in
  `ksx-api::live` so none of them describes it twice. The cabinet subscribes
  IN-PROCESS; Studio is a separate process, so the same stream leaves the
  daemon on its own outbound-only pipe (`ksx_api::LIVE_PIPE_NAME`, one thread
  per viewer) and Studio re-emits it as Server-Sent Events. It is deliberately
  NOT a verb on this control pipe: that one serves connections sequentially on
  a single thread, so a stream held open for the life of a browser tab would
  mean no `status`/`start`/`stop` was ever answered again
  (`ksx_api::LiveSource`).
- **Capture-thread purity.** No tokio, no allocation, no locks in the capture
  thread — and therefore no GUI-serving code anywhere near it. Any live
  monitor coalesces to display rate (~60 Hz); full fidelity lives in
  `--record`, not a socket a browser can backpressure.
- **Escapes stay in the capture path.** LeftCtrl ×5 and Ctrl+Alt+Del are
  evaluated inside the capture thread, upstream of every channel. A GUI stop
  button is a convenience on top; it must never become a link in the escape
  chain, because the escapes' one property is that they work when everything
  downstream — the GUI included — is wedged.
- **Config stays hand-editable TOML.** The GUI edits the same files the user
  can edit, and changes land by RE-READING those files — never a parallel
  binary store, never GUI-only state. How the re-read reaches a running
  session depends on what changed: a binding-only edit is applied by rebuilding
  the engine's dispatch tables off-thread and swapping them in
  (`ApplyBindings`), anything structural is still a clean stop + re-read +
  start (`Reload`). Both paths read the same TOML; neither patches a live
  pipeline's state in place, and the swap releases anything held so it cannot
  strand a pressed control. **JSON interop does not weaken this**: `ksx config
  import` writes the same hand-editable TOML files through the same store, and
  the change still lands by re-reading them. JSON is a transport, never a
  parallel store — see "Config interop" above.
- **A surface that cannot act must SAY so, per click.** No control may be a
  silent no-op. When the daemon is unreachable Studio shows a banner at the top
  of the page ("No daemon — ksx Studio can see your config but cannot change
  anything") with the exact command to start one (profile flag included),
  renders every dead control visibly inert — a CSS look, never the `disabled`
  attribute, which would swallow the click that owes an explanation — and
  answers each click by naming the control, the reason, and the `ksx map`
  one-liner that works anyway.
