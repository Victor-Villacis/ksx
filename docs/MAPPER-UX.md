# Mapper UX specification — synthesized from the field study (2026-08-05)

Sources: `docs/research/` field studies of the commercial tier (reWASD, Steam
Input, Xbox Accessories, 8BitDo, DS4Windows/JoyToKey/AntiMicroX/x360ce,
Synapse/G HUB) and the emulation/arcade lineage (EmulationStation/RetroBat —
read from this cabinet's own install — RetroArch, MAME, BYOAC folklore,
operator TEST menus, fighting-game button check). The product brief: "the most
complex tool with the simplest interface."

## The commandments (each one evidence-backed, none negotiable)

1. **The physical press is the pointer.** Selecting a control by pressing it
   (reWASD hook, JoyToKey row-highlight, x360ce Record, ES "HOLD A BUTTON ON
   YOUR DEVICE") is the universal grammar of every loved mapper; naming
   controls from lists is the universal marker of hated ones. On a panel of
   30 identical buttons this is existential, not cosmetic.
2. **Every mapping screen is also a button-check screen.** Live echo on the
   mapping surface itself (x360ce's lit-up pad, MAME's Input Devices, Naomi
   INPUT TEST, Tekken-7-at-character-select). RetroArch had to retrofit one
   by community bounty. Requires the live socket — **which SHIPPED
   2026-08-08**: `\\.\pipe\ksx-live` out of the daemon, Server-Sent Events
   out of Studio, and `/check` is its first consumer. The mapper's own
   in-place echo is the remaining half.
3. **Two flows, one gesture each.** ES proves the sequential wizard (press,
   press, press — auto-advance, hold-to-skip, completeness audit, nothing
   saved until OK) is perfect for FIRST CONTACT and miserable for
   corrections (~40 s of hold-to-skip to fix one bind). MAME proves
   press-in-place single rebind is the correction flow. Ship both. Fixing
   one binding must never cost more than three actions.
4. **Render as summary, legend as table.** The controller drawing decorated
   with binding state (Razer's modified-vs-stock highlight) for glancing;
   the legend grid (JoyToKey's one enduring virtue) for scanning. Both are
   the same data, both are click targets.
5. **Minimal nouns, guaranteed road home.** reWASD's profile→config→slot→
   apply pyramid is its own forum's top complaint; the Xbox app's immutable
   default + one-click restore is the quiet masterstroke. ksx exposes
   exactly two nouns (profile, preset), single rebinds commit immediately
   (MAME-style), the wizard commits transactionally (ES-style), and every
   preset keeps a session-start backup + the built-in defaults as the
   always-there floor.
6. **Speak positions and presses, never labels.** Prompt "SOUTH", not "A"
   (ES's Nintendo-proof vocabulary); persona-aware display (✕ on a
   PlayStation slot); conflicts flashed inline the moment they happen
   ("ALREADY TAKEN — G is P2's A"), not after.
7. **Duplicates are information, not errors.** Steam proves overlap is a
   feature; Synapse-4's silent wipe of binding A when saving B is the
   cardinal sin. In ksx this is doubly true: keyboard fan-out (one key
   driving several slots) is THE product. The v5 conflict dialog softens
   accordingly: same-preset duplicate = **not a conflict at all** — it is a
   multi-bind, written with no dialog and then SHOWN ("also A · B");
   CROSS-SLOT duplicate = informational badge ("also P2's A — this is
   fan-out"), never a blocking dialog. No save ever touches a binding other
   than the one being edited without showing it first — and since 2026-08-06
   the WRITER cannot either: the only path that unbinds a control the caller
   did not name is `--move-from`/`"move_from"`, which names it in the request
   and again in the response (`moved_from`).

   **MACROS ARE THE ONE EXCEPTION, and it is not a softening of this
   commandment — it is the same reasoning applied to a different kind of
   thing.** Since 2026-08-06 a key that already starts one macro will not
   quietly start a second *in the same preset*: the write is refused, both
   macros and the key are named, and `--force` is the way through. Duplicates
   are information because a binding is declarative STATE — two keys setting
   one bit compose, and the result has no opinion about order or timing. A
   macro is an imperative TIMELINE, and two timelines started together do not
   compose: they interleave, and the game reads a superposition that neither
   step list contains. Fan-out is the product for state and a bug for time.
   Cross-slot and cross-preset sharing are untouched — that is fan-out again.
   The mapper offers no "start both anyway" button, on purpose: a one-click
   override beside a warning is how people click past warnings, and this
   particular warning cost an evening.

   Its cheap companion, on the same card: **switch a macro OFF instead of
   deleting it** (`enabled = false`) — the steps and the trigger row stay
   exactly where they are and nothing runs. You do it to TEST (isolate one
   macro, get the others back unchanged) and to COMPETE (a tournament wants
   macros off, not lost). For a whole panel there is the slot's `macros =
   "off"`, which overrides every macro's own switch; the mapper *states* that
   one above the grid — naming the file and the line — rather than offering a
   control it has no config writer for.
8. **Player identity is static; the chain is visible.** I-PAC bakes P1–P4
   into scancodes and MAME never asks again; RetroArch's dynamic ports are
   a decade of cabinet forum grief. ksx slots are static by config, and one
   screen must show the whole chain: physical key → slot/persona → control —
   RetroArch's binds-vs-remaps saga proves invisible layers cost a decade
   of confusion even when the model is right.
9. **The best mapping session is none.** I-PAC ships MAME-ready; RetroBat
   compiles one mapping into 130 emulators per launch, with the competing
   mapper disabled. KSX's guided first run stages a standard two-player
   controller layout, keeping the out-of-box experience close to zero mapping.
   The mapper exists for the exceptions.

## Canvas authoring migration (decision, 2026-08-22)

Nocturne's permanent right-hand binding ledger is deprecated as a spatial
surface, not as a capability set. The canvas is the relation now: physical
keys → real processing steps → virtual-controller controls. A giant editor
card placed between every source and destination would falsely claim the
editor participates in runtime, so it is not the replacement.

The replacement has four parts:

1. **Semantic graph selection** is separate from widget move/resize selection.
   Click selects one endpoint or route; Ctrl/Shift-click and a touch Select
   mode build a set. A contextual action dock describes the exact keys,
   controls, routes and processors selected.
2. **The cords are the two old tabs.** Selecting a key reveals every control
   it drives; selecting a control reveals every key that drives it. Find
   (Ctrl+K) searches keys, controls, players, macros and routes, then pans and
   highlights matches instead of filtering a second copy of the graph.
3. **Only real behavior becomes a node.** A macro remains a processor. Toggle
   and turbo form one compact behavior processor immediately before the
   destination control, because those settings apply to that control's
   combined incoming keys. Plain hold stays a direct cord.
4. **A nonpersistent Connections table remains the accessible/no-script
   escape hatch.** Native forms and consequence text survive there (and on
   `/map`); they no longer reserve a quarter of the main canvas.

### Canvas route and processor placement contract (revised 2026-08-24)

The shipped direct-route presentation is one independent, axis-aware lasso
curve for every physical-key → virtual-control relation. Direct cords never
merge into a player harness, trunk, shared bus or bundled segment. Fan-out is
therefore one real source endpoint with separately traceable outgoing cords;
fan-in likewise keeps every incoming relation distinct. Each cord attaches to
the exact visible keycap and controller control, receives its own deterministic
lane, and remains independently inspectable.

Macro segments are the deliberate causal exception to a direct key → control
cord: they remain explicit key → processor and processor → control relations.
Macro processors auto-place between their live source and destination groups.
Dragging a processor, or nudging its move control with the keyboard, stores a
manual offset from that automatic position; the relationship can therefore
move with its widgets without discarding the user's adjustment. The processor
exposes an explicit **Auto** action which removes that offset and returns it to
automatic placement.
If browser storage refuses either write, the card stays useful for the current
session, labels that state visibly, and keeps a keyboard-reachable retry rather
than claiming the change was saved.

Processor offsets are canvas presentation state only. Canonical keys,
functions, macro topology and mapping writes remain backend-owned; moving a
processor never changes a binding.

Bulk connection grammar is explicit:

- one key + many controls = fan-out;
- many keys + one control = fan-in;
- many keys + many controls must choose Pair in selection order, Connect all
  combinations (with the exact edge count), or Map in sequence.

Ghost cords preview the result before one atomic staged write. One physical
key shared by four players remains one source endpoint with four outgoing
cords, never four fake keycaps. The batch write carries the staged revision,
exact additions/removals and strategy; conflict/consequence composition stays
server-owned and the operation is all-or-nothing.

Migration order is contractual: first normalize the backend authoring graph
and remove every dependency on the ledger DOM; then ship read-only selection
and Find; then direct/bulk authoring; then behavior and macro lifecycle; only
then default the table closed and remove the permanent pane after parity tests.
Hiding the pane before `Map all`, label lookup, learn/assign and open-row state
stop querying it would silently remove features and is therefore forbidden.

## The three builds (in order)

**Build A status (v7, 2026-08-05).** Landed on the mapper page: every zone
now carries its own IDENTITY on the art (persona-aware, canonical colours —
the vendored drawing has no letters, so "I can see G is mapped to A but I
can't see the A xbox button" was a real gap in commandment 4's "render as
summary"); MULTI-SELECT (Ctrl/Shift-click on desktop, a "Select multiple"
toggle for touch, a floating bar with "Map all to one key") which exposes the
engine's native multi-bind (docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §1a) with one captured
key written to N controls; and commandment 7 finished for the same-preset
case — a key already used by another control in the SAME preset is no longer
offered a "Replace" dialog, it is written and then SHOWN as a group ("also
A · B" badges on every co-bound legend row, cool-toned key tags on the art).
Cross-slot duplicates keep their existing informational dialog.

**Engine side: CLOSED (2026-08-06).** `ksx map` no longer moves a key between
controls. A same-preset duplicate is written as a multi-bind, every other
control keeps the key, and the response reports the co-bindings
(`also_drives`) — so the multi-select arm's N sequential writes all stick and
the page's honest report ("P now drives A · B · RT") is the one it prints.
The old move survives as an explicit, singular `--move-from FUNCTION` /
`"move_from"`, which names exactly what it unbound; `--force` now only means
"bind here anyway despite ANOTHER SLOT's preset" and removes nothing. The
legend still derives sharing from disk, never from what the UI assumed.

**Diagonals: SHIPPED (v16, 2026-08-06).** The macro grid's direction groups
are eight columns each — `↑ ↖ ← ↙ ↓ ↘ → ↗`, in ring order, 25 zones → 37
columns — so a diagonal is a thing you point at instead of a thing you have
to know how to build. Ticking `↘` stores `dpad.down + dpad.right` on the
mechanism whose column you hit; a step that already holds a pair (hand-written,
imported, or from a motion helper) DISPLAYS as `↘`, including when it is
spelled at a partial deflection (`ly.-16384 + lx.max`, shown dashed) and when
a button rides along with it. The stored model is untouched — this is a
presentation layer over `ksx_core::diagonal::fold`, and every row spells out
the pair it wrote beside its name so the file is never a mystery.

**All four, because of the full circle.** `↘` alone would miss the point: a
half-circle needs `↙` as well, a dragon punch needs `↘` specifically, and a
360 (the spinning piledriver) walks all eight positions of the gate — four of
its eight steps are diagonals. So every diagonal is recognized on read-back
and expanded on write on all three mechanisms, and the motion helpers now
offer the full family: quarter-circle and half-circle both facings, dragon
punch both facings, and **360 both facings** (`→ ↘ ↓ ↙ ← ↖ ↑ ↗` and its
mirror). Each inserted step displaying as its own diagonal is the proof that
recognition and expansion agree. ⚠ *The sign*: "up" on a stick is `ly.max`,
not `ly.min` — a mirrored sign gives an `↖` that reads back perfectly in every
reader on the page and does nothing in the game, so all twelve
(mechanism × diagonal) pairs are asserted name by name in ksx-core, in
`render_map.rs`, and in the browser suite against the TOML the file will
carry.

*Why nobody else has it, and why the ordering is what it is.* Steam Input's
D-pad is "4 binding slots in the cardinal directions"; 8-Way (Overlap) only
widens the wedge. reWASD's own support answer to "map a diagonal" is *build a
Shortcut out of two zones*. MAME's input map is four cardinals. GP2040-CE
treats diagonals purely as cardinal pairs and spends its whole SOCD feature on
what happens when the pair is illegal. Steam Deck's eight-direction D-pad
binding is still an open feature request. So ksx's storage model is the model
the entire field uses — the gap was the lens, not the data. Ring order
(numpad 8 7 4 1 2 3 6 9) rather than numpad-ascending because a piano roll is
read as a picture: a quarter-circle becomes a staircase, a half-circle a
straight 45° line, a dragon punch a hook. Notation follows the field split —
**arrows on screen** (SF6's input history, every Capcom move list), **words
for the name** (compass, not `d/f`: player 2 is not an edge case), **numpad in
the tooltip** as the lookup key for anyone who read it on Dustloop or typed it
into MAME's `joystick_map`. Direction glyphs are unified on arrows everywhere,
including the art's zone labels: a diagonal that did not look like the same
family as its two parents would defeat the lens.

**Build A — core shipped.** The visual controller, binding inspector, physical
key inventory, multi-key editing, conflict handling, recovery actions, macros,
persona-aware vocabulary, and direct live echo are in Studio. `/map` and
`/check` consume the same read-only SSE feed. The mapper paints it only when
the running session origin matches the saved config or staged draft currently
on screen; matching player numbers alone are not enough. The remaining
interaction polish is passive press-to-select.

**Build B — product first run shipped.** `/start` holds a complete setup in the
idle daemon, and `/map?target=stage&slot=N` points this same mapper at it.
Bindings, multiple keys, auto-fire, and macros remain in memory; refusals do
not mutate the draft. Setup then asks split-or-freeze and keeps Save separate
from Play. The older sequential `ksx setup` prompt remains a developer CLI
surface, not the installed customer's wizard.

**Build C — button check: SHIPPED (2026-08-08), and so is the socket under
it.** `/check`, one click from the mapper on every screen's nav: press panel
keys → the virtual controls light across ALL slots simultaneously (the fan-out
made visible — four pads glowing from one keystroke is also the product demo).
Doubles as wiring diagnostics (the operator TEST heritage).

*The socket.* The daemon's fan-out (`crate::feed::LiveSink`, which the cabinet
window has subscribed to in-process since M9) now leaves the process on a
channel of its own — `\\.\pipe\ksx-live`, outbound-only, one thread per
viewer — and Studio re-emits it as Server-Sent Events at `/api/live`. It is
NOT a verb on the control pipe, and the reason is on `ksx_api::LiveSource`:
that pipe serves connections sequentially on one thread, so a stream held open
would take the daemon's whole control surface down with the tab. SSE rather
than a WebSocket because the stream is one-directional, inherits `guard.rs`
and the CSP unchanged, and reconnects itself. **One stream, three consumers**
holds: the E8 light bus and the 3D viewer subscribe to the same
`LiveSubscription`, in-process or over the same pipe.

*The rendering.* Chips, not four controller drawings — the mapper's 25
absolutely-positioned hit zones per persona, four times over at quarter size
on a phone, would be four sets of geometry to keep aligned and a fight with
the responsive pass. So Build C is the other half of commandment 4 ("legend as
TABLE"): one auto-fill grid of touch-floor chips carrying slot, canonical
control name and the key that drives it. The roster is the BACKEND's —
`MapperSlot::bindings`' key set, unbound controls included, because that is
exactly the control somebody is standing at the cabinet trying to test.

*Commandment 2 is now visible in place.* `/map` consumes the same read-only
feed as `/check`, but paints it only after a fresh map/session-origin
handshake proves the running setup matches the saved or staged target on
screen. Controller hits and the selected keyboard's physical keys illuminate
in the mapper; observable stream/session changes clear the ledger before any
new frame is accepted.

## Explicitly deferred (recorded so they're chosen, not forgotten)

- ~~MAME-style OR-chaining (multiple physical keys per control)~~ — **fully
  shipped.** Readers show the whole key list; add/remove/replace/clear and Undo
  send one complete `keys` vector. Staged writes perform selection, duplicate
  checking, and application under the daemon's one stage lock, so concurrent
  edits cannot silently lose a key or create an unforced cross-player duplicate.
- Steam-style activators (hold/double-press) — engine feature first, UI
  after; belongs with shift-layers vocabulary from the PadForge audit.
- Community preset sharing (Steam's playtime-ranked configs) — M7+.
- ~~WinUSB-claimed panels cannot be learned through RawInput.~~ The current
  learner is daemon-owned and observes the capture-side panel tap. Studio
  binds Identify and Mapping results to the exact daemon generation, so a
  competing tab/action cannot lend its key to the wrong write.

## The 2026-native layer (what no tool in the field study could do)

The study's tools span 1997–2026, but even the newest think like desktop
apps. ksx Studio is a web surface backed by an AI-drivable CLI — these are
the capabilities that stack only for us, ranked by leverage:

1. **Close the loop in the browser: the Gamepad API sees our virtual pads.**
   Our X360/DS4 targets are real controllers, so `navigator.getGamepads()`
   in the very page doing the mapping can read them — no socket, no new
   backend. Press a panel button → ksx translates → the virtual pad changes
   → the mapper's render lights up. That is END-TO-END verification of the
   entire product pipeline, drawn on the mapping surface (commandment 2),
   and it complements Build C's shipped physical-side SSE echo with an
   independent virtual-side proof of the final controller state. (Caveats:
   the page must be
   visible, first read needs a user gesture, mapping-order quirks per
   browser — feature-detect and degrade to socket echo later.)
2. **AI-assisted mapping (E5 grown up).** Every mapper in the study makes
   humans do the layout. ksx's CLI verbs + MCP mean an assistant can be a
   first-class mapping surface: "set P3 and P4 up like P1 but mirrored",
   "this preset for street fighter — what's wrong?", "map this new panel"
   → the assistant drives `ksx map`/the wizard and the page shows the
   result live. The mapper UI and the AI share one control surface by
   construction — no other tool in the field can say that.
3. **QR-code handoff.** The status page (cab screen) shows a QR; the phone
   scans it and lands in the mapper. When LAN mode ships (pairing token,
   E7), the QR carries the pairing — the 2026 answer to "type this IP on
   your phone". Zero cost to print the QR now for localhost-forwarded
   setups; full value at LAN time.
4. **PWA install.** Manifest + the service worker we already ship → "Add to
   Home Screen" and the phone-at-cab surface becomes an app with an icon,
   full-screen, no browser chrome. Cheap; do it in Build A polish.
5. **Command palette (Ctrl+K).** Every CONTROL-SURFACE verb searchable in
   one keystroke — start the Example Launcher profile, open P2 mapper, restore defaults.
   The 2026 power-user pattern, and for us it's a thin view over verbs that
   already exist.
6. **Multi-surface sync.** Cab TV shows the big render, phone drives the
   mapping, both fed by the same poller/socket state — presenter mode falls
   out of the architecture (islands + shared API) rather than being built.
7. **Platform polish as table stakes**: View Transitions for screen moves,
   `prefers-reduced-motion` honored, container queries for the phone/TV
   split, full keyboard-and-pad navigability of the mapper itself (Steam
   proved config UIs should be drivable from the thing being configured —
   on a cabinet, that's the panel).

Current placement: Build B's product first run, Build C's live check, and the
mapper's direct physical-side echo are shipped. Virtual-side Gamepad API echo,
QR/LAN pairing, PWA presentation, the command palette, and multi-surface sync
remain future work; none is part of the current fresh-install acceptance claim.
