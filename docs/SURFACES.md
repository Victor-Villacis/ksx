# Surfaces: what each one is for

ksx has three faces — the CLI, the egui cabinet app, and Studio in a browser —
and one backend. This file records which face owns what, in what order they get
built, and the alternatives that were considered and rejected. It exists so that
"which surface does this go on?" is answered once instead of re-argued per
feature.

Written 2026-08-07, after `ksx device pick` shipped as a verb with no web face
and the question came up for the fourth time. Audited and corrected the same
week — the matrix had four cells describing capabilities that do not exist, and
§1's supporting anecdote was false in both halves. Every correction below names
the code it was checked against.

## §1 The backend owns state; every surface is a view

Already the architecture, stated here so it stops being implicit. From
`crates/ksx-backend/src/device_edit.rs`:

> One writer, like every other write. A typed spec in, a pure plan out, a
> timestamped backup taken before the write, and the store's atomic save doing
> the I/O.

And from `ksx studio --help`:

> every button is one backend verb, no GUI-only code paths.

**No surface may hold logic another surface would need.** A capability becomes a
typed spec and a pure plan in the backend; surfaces call it and render the
result. `ksx-api` is the wire contract between them.

### Where this is currently broken, on purpose and by accident

Stated here because an unqualified rule that the code visibly does not follow
teaches people to ignore the rule rather than to fix the code.

- **The mapper's timing arithmetic exists three times.** `ksx_core` owns it;
  `ksx-studio/src/render_map.rs` mirrors `MIN_STEP_MS`, `TURBO_MAX_HZ`, the
  frame maths, `MacroStep::effective_ms`, the turbo on/off split, the turbo gap
  and two SOCD/diagonal helpers, each with a comment saying it is a mirror; and
  `studio-ui/src/MapIsland.ts` mirrors the same values a third time so the
  no-JS page and the interactive island agree. The Rust copy is pinned to
  `ksx_core` by a test. **The TypeScript copy is pinned to nothing**, which
  makes it the one that will drift, and it will drift silently because a wrong
  step preview looks like a wrong step preview and nothing else.
- **The mappable-function vocabulary lives in the surface.** `ZONE_XBOX` and
  `ZONE_DS4` in `render_map.rs` hold the 25 canonical pad functions, and the
  test that checks them re-types the same 25 strings, so adding a function to
  `ksx-core` fails nothing. The bindable-*key* vocabulary next to it does this
  right — it is pinned against `ksx_core::key::Key::ALL` through a test-only
  dev-dependency — and the fix is the same shape: a canonical `ALL` on the
  function type, then compare against it. There is no such list to compare
  against yet, which is why this is still written down instead of tested.
- **The egui takes a few decisions of its own.** `Screen::ButtonCheck`'s action
  clears a local log, `Screen::Status`'s prints a nag, and `Ask::Refresh` is a
  re-read: three actions that are not backend verbs, in a file whose own comment
  says there is no such variant. All three are state-free, so the harm is nil
  and the claim is what is wrong, not the code.

The cost of breaking this rule is concrete in the present tree.
`MachineSource::devices()` is implemented in `ksx-backend/src/sources.rs`, but
the cabinet navigation contains only ButtonCheck, Status, Session, Profiles,
and Presets. The backend read is compiled behind
`#[cfg(all(windows, feature = "cabinet"))]` even though that surface has no
devices screen and no caller for the read.

So the failure mode is symmetric, and the rule needs both halves: a surface must
not own a capability the backend lacks, **and a backend verb with no face is not
finished either** — it is untested against a real caller, and its shape is a
guess.

That was the surface-parity guard on the task list (#26), and it now exists:
`crates/ksx-app/tests/parity.rs` walks the clap command tree, reads Studio's
routes out of `Router::new()` and the cabinet's screens and `Ask` variants out
of its source, and asks of every cell in §3 whether the tree agrees. A verb no
row names and no exemption covers fails it. So does a cell claiming a face that
is not there — and so does the opposite, which is what it found on the day it
was written: two cells still saying `planned` about pages that had shipped.
What it cannot check is a capability nobody wrote a row for, which is the
remaining reason to keep §3 current by hand.

### §1a Rendered COPY is logic too, and one page proves it

A Studio island seeds its signals from the server's paint and then rewrites the
same signals from a 2 s poll. It is very easy to let the island compose its own
sentences from the polled data, and every one of them is then a second
implementation of a backend rule in another language.

The Profiles page shipped that way and review found the drift immediately: the
slot-count input's ceiling was `createSignal("16")` in `ProfilesIsland.ts`, its
setter was never called, and no payload field could reach it. `MAX_SLOTS` has
already been raised once (task #17). The next raise would have had the server
render `max="32"` and hydration write `16` straight back over it — a *legal*
input silently refused, for the same reason `main.rs`'s `slot_arg` module
exists. The summary lines, the pill mapping and the row text were duplicated the
same way; they had not drifted yet.

The shape that fixes it: **one serialized derived block**. `ProfilesDerived`
(`crates/ksx-studio/src/snapshot.rs`) holds every displayed string, every count,
both numeric ceilings and every `show:` boolean, computed once from the provider
data; `render_profiles.rs` injects it into the FMIR slots and `applyProfiles`
assigns it to signals. Neither composes anything. A new page copies this, not
the two-halves version.

### §1b A refused READ is not an empty result

"I could not read this" and "there is nothing here" are different sentences, and
a user acts on them differently: one says *go fix your config*, the other says
*go make your first profile*. A surface that renders the second when the first
is true has reported success over a read that did not happen — which is the
failure mode this project keeps hitting (the session that read as healthy while
the arcade panel was dead, because a WinUSB board had fallen back to
Interception).

The rule: **an `Err` from a provider gets a typed field on the payload, never a
`Default::default()` view.** Substituting a default is what turns a refusal into
a count of zero, and a count of zero into a confident wrong sentence. See
`ProfilesPayload::profiles_error` / `presets_error`, and note the second-order
bug the Profiles page had: a defaulted `PresetsView` set `noPresetsYet`, whose
copy points at a template form fed by *the same read that just failed* — a
closed loop with a wrong sentence on it.

A page that gets this right needs a test that fails when the two are conflated;
asserting the failure state renders is not enough, because that passes while the
absence sentence renders too.

## §2 Build order

1. **Backend verb** — typed spec, pure plan, tested against synthetic fixtures.
2. **CLI** — the cheapest surface to test and the one CI can drive headlessly.
3. **The surface the task is actually performed on** (§3, §4).

There is no "egui first or web first" question. That framing assumes a surface
owns a capability, which §1 forbids. The real question is only ever *which
surface does a human perform this task on*, and that is answered by the matrix.

## §3 The capability matrix

> **This table is a test.** `crates/ksx-app/tests/parity.rs` parses it and
> checks every cell against the tree — the clap command tree, Studio's routes,
> the cabinet's screens and `Ask` variants. Editing a row means editing that
> test's anchors too, and a word the guard has not been taught (the vocabulary
> is below) fails it rather than passing unread. Adding a ROW with no anchors
> also fails: an unbound row is checked by nothing, which is the state the whole
> table was in before the guard existed.

| Capability | CLI | egui (cabinet) | Studio (browser) |
|---|---|---|---|
| First run: stage a setup, save or play | planned (`ksx stage`) | — | **primary** |
| Author presets / key mappings | owns | — | **primary** |
| Edit configuration | owns | slot→preset only | **primary** |
| Create / update / delete profiles | planned | view | **primary** |
| Device pick / remove | owns | planned | **primary** |
| WinUSB claim / release | owns (advanced) | planned | **primary** (installed `/start`; explicit UAC) |
| "Press a button, see it light" | input only (`ksx monitor`) | **primary** | view (§8) |
| Is it working: pads, drivers | owns | **primary** | view |
| Spawn test pads / prune the bus | owns | — | **primary** (§3a) |
| Start / stop / switch profile | owns | **primary** | convenience |
| Record / replay a session | owns | planned (§3b) | planned (§3b) |

"owns" = the verb lives here. "primary" = where a human does it. "view" =
renders backend state, takes no decisions. **"planned" = nothing is there** —
and it is spelled out because the previous version of this table used "view" for
two cells that render nothing at all, which reads as a shipped capability and
cost an audit to catch.

Four cells were corrected, each against the code:

- **Edit configuration — egui.** Was "—". The egui *does* write config: the Presets
  screen builds an `Ask::Assign`, which becomes a `SlotAssignRequest` that
  rewrites a `[[slot]]`'s preset. It also decides **which file** the write lands
  in (`config.toml` or a `games.toml` profile) in `assign_destination`, whose
  own doc comment records the data-loss bug the previous version of that
  decision caused. That is a targeting decision taken in a surface; it is the
  strongest live counter-example to §1 in the tree, and it stays until the
  destination rule moves behind the verb.
- **Edit configuration — Studio.** *Superseded 2026-08-08; see below.* Was
  "**primary**". At the audit no Studio route wrote `config.toml` or
  `games.toml`; the only config-adjacent route re-read. Every `/map/*` write
  went to a preset file. `AppState` held no `MachineSource`, and `ControlSource`
  had exactly one config-writing verb (`slot-assign`) which Studio never called.
  It was the right destination, so it stayed in the table — as a plan.
- **Device pick / remove, WinUSB claim / release — egui.** Both were "view".
  The cabinet has no device mutation screen, so both remain planned there.
  The old audit also concluded that Studio could never own WinUSB because it
  could not elevate safely. That premise is now superseded: installed `/start`
  calls typed `MachineSource::winusb_prepare`/`winusb_release`, which elevate a
  fixed GUI helper and return only after exact re-survey. The browser never
  supplies a helper path or backend.
- **"Press a button, see it light" — CLI and Studio.** The CLI cell was "—",
  but `ksx monitor` streams `<alias> <Key> down|up` per keystroke: that is the
  input half, and what it lacks is the second column the egui has (what the
  panel sent *and* what the pad published — screens.rs explains that the pair is
  the diagnostic). The Studio cell claimed "useful on phone (§6)": there is no
  live-input channel in Studio at any screen size — no feed on `AppState`, no
  frame type, nothing — and the cross-reference pointed at the wrong section
  (mobile is §8; §6 is launching).

Two more were corrected on 2026-08-08, and this time by the guard rather than
by a person reading the table — both in the direction that is cheaper to make
and harder to notice, a face that SHIPPED while the cell still said `planned`:

- **Edit configuration — Studio.** Was "planned primary". `/setup` has since
  shipped and the plan is the surface: `/setup/import` rewrites the whole
  config root and `/setup/slot` posts the same `ControlSource::assign_slot`
  that `ksx slot assign` performs. **primary**, which is where the bullet above
  already said it belonged.
- **Profile management — Studio.** `/profiles` now creates, updates and deletes
  saved game profiles through typed `MachineSource` verbs, and switches through
  the existing control verb. The CLI CRUD half is explicitly planned rather
  than hidden inside a broader "owns" claim; the cabinet list remains a view
  and its operating switch belongs to the start/stop row below.
- **Device pick / remove — Studio.** Was "planned (#22)"; #22 shipped
  `/devices`, `/devices/pick` and `/devices/remove`. The egui half stays planned
  and drops the issue number, because #22 was never about the cabinet — its five
  screens are still ButtonCheck, Status, Session, Profiles, Presets.

### §3c The first-run row, and the build order it ran backwards

Row 1 is new on 2026-08-08, and it is the first row in this table whose **CLI
cell is honestly `planned`**. `docs/FIRST-RUN.md` is a spec for a product
someone who is not us can use, and its §1 premise is that no step may require a
shell — so the surface came first and `ksx stage` is owed. That is §2's build
order run 1 → 3 with 2 skipped, the same way `/profiles/new` did it, and it is
recorded here rather than quietly for the reason that entry gives: the backend
half then has no second caller checking its shape.

What exists: `ksx_core::StagedSetup` (the value, with no path to a file), the
four `stage*` pipe verbs, and Studio's `/start` performing all of them. What
does not: any way to stage a setup from a terminal. The four verbs are on the
control pipe, so the CLI half is a driver over `ControlSource`, not new logic.

**Moment 6 is implemented without a second mapper.** A staged controller can
start from a served layout, then `/map?target=stage&slot=N` opens the existing
button/chord/turbo/macro authoring UI against the slot's optional full
`PresetFile` snapshot. `staged_bind_edit` and `staged_macro_edit` prepare pure
edits, validate cross-stage conflicts and apply one `StageEdit::SetBindings`
only after acceptance. Refusal leaves the stage unchanged; force has the same
explicit conflict meaning as the saved mapper. No staged GET/edit touches disk,
takes a backup or claims a config reload. Save and Play remain separate.

The daemon's empty-default startup is part of this row too: it stays alive as
an idle staging/control host with no session, capture, claim or pads. Explicit
empty game profiles and other plan failures still refuse. The terminal driver
`ksx stage` remains planned; it must call this same control contract rather
than growing a second staging implementation.

**This row is also why the guard's bookkeeping changed.** It used to require
every CLI anchor to exist in the clap tree, whatever its cell said — which is
right for a cell claiming `owns` and wrong for one saying `planned`, where a
name that does not resolve is exactly the claim being made. The egui and Studio
columns have always worked that way (`Screen::Mapper` and `/buttons` name
nothing, which is what makes their `—` honest); the CLI column now does too, and
`every_cell_claiming_a_shipped_face_has_one` is what holds the shipped
direction.

### §3a Why installed WinUSB preparation has a narrow Studio face

WinUSB is still the most dangerous action in the matrix: it takes a keyboard
out of the Windows keyboard stack. The old conclusion was therefore “never in
Studio.” That solved the browser problem by leaving a clean-install customer
with a terminal-only dead end. The shipped design changes the privilege
boundary, not the safety bar.

Studio owns only the consent and exact stale-action guard. `/start` shows the
selected human-named keyboard, states the ordinary-typing consequence, and
requires three independent confirmations: a different tested keyboard, consent
to rebind this selected keyboard, and consent to a machine-local signing
certificate. The forms carry the served selector and instance only. They carry
no backend, command, DLL, path, certificate name, or provider result.

The server then re-reads the stage and machine inventory. It requires one exact
selector match, one exact case-insensitive interface instance, WinUSB
eligibility, and the correct current binding. Unsupported, ambiguous,
shared-hardware-ID, stale and last-keyboard targets refuse before elevation.
Because a Windows package matches a hardware ID, the user is told to release
before connecting another identical keyboard. If one is connected later,
Studio refuses to guess between twins: unplug it, then Release removes the
shared package so the twin returns to HidUsb when reconnected.

Only an installed Program Files copy may elevate its fixed GUI-subsystem
`ksx-winusb-helper.exe`; that helper may load only its fixed installed sibling
`libwdi.dll`. Both canonicalize from Windows Known Folders and repeat live
owner/DACL/reparse checks. Portable and user-writable copies refuse. The helper
journals, performs the package transaction, compensates failures or records
recovery-required, and re-surveys. Studio accepts only the typed boundary's
canonical `prepared`/`released` state plus the exact instance, then performs a
guarded stage backend transition. Helper stdout, a zero exit code, or a browser
field can never produce success.

The existing loopback Host and mutating-Origin guard still wraps both POSTs.
This does not make driver mutation safe on a LAN; pairing/token work remains a
prerequisite before Studio binds beyond loopback.

Pad testing keeps its different contract. A test-pad action cannot lock out the
keyboard, so it needs state bounds and clear consequences rather than UAC
device ownership. `/start` still cannot install ViGEmBus: that belongs to the
installer's explicit checkbox. A surface may own one narrowly designed elevated
transaction without becoming a generic driver console.

### §3b Record / replay, and why both other cells say `planned`

`ksx monitor --record` writes a session; `ksx play` plays one back into the
real pipeline. Together they are one capability, and today the CLI owns all of
it.

Both other cells are `planned` rather than `never`, and the distinction is the
one §3 draws: nothing is there *yet*, and there is no reason in principle for
that. An attract-mode loop is a **cabinet** feature — it belongs on the egui,
started from the panel with no keyboard in reach, which is precisely what §4
says that surface is for. Recording a session and picking one to replay is a
list and a button, which is what §5 says Studio is good at. Neither is written,
so neither is claimed.

What is genuinely CLI-shaped, and would stay here even after both faces exist,
is the *argument surface*: `--as`, `--speed`, `--game`. Those are the flags of
someone debugging a mapping against a recording, which is a keyboard-and-shell
activity by nature. A cabinet needs one button that says "play the demo" and a
browser needs a list of recordings — neither needs the flags.

## §4 The egui is an appliance panel, not a worse browser

The egui's five screens (`ksx-cabinet/src/nav.rs`) are ButtonCheck, Status,
Session, Profiles, Presets — and ButtonCheck is described in the source as "the
spine". That is correct and it generalises:

**At an arcade cabinet there is no mouse and no keyboard. The panel is the
input.** A browser UI cannot be driven by an arcade stick; the egui already
responds to panel presses. This is a structural advantage no web surface can
take, and it is why "just use Studio for everything" is not on the table.

The egui's job is therefore everything a person does **standing at the machine,
with only the panel to touch**: confirm it works, start and stop, switch
profile. Anything requiring text entry belongs elsewhere.

## §5 Studio is the workbench

Studio binds `127.0.0.1` and refuses anything else — `ksx-studio/src/error.rs`
returns `NonLoopbackBind` rather than serving a LAN address. Its **pages** are
`/start` (the first run), `/` (status), `/map` (the mapper), `/check` (the
button check), `/pads` (the ViGEm bus and its two verbs), `/devices` (the
picker), `/profiles` (profiles & presets) and `/setup` (the configuration).

`/start` and `/setup` are the two that look like each other and are not, and
the difference is a contract rather than a layout. **`/setup` is the
disk-backed maintenance checklist**, but not every control on it is a write:
the board step links to `/devices`, slot assignment performs one saved-config
write, the proof step only operates the daemon learner, Export is a read, and
Import is a dry run unless its consent box is ticked. A write that does happen
is a complete backend act rather than a half-written wizard step.

**`/start` does not use the saved config as its draft.** It drives
`ksx_core::StagedSetup`, held in the daemon for the length of a visit and with
no path to a file (`FIRST-RUN.md` §2). Its staged choices and accepted mapper
edits remain in memory; Play starts that value without saving; only the button
marked Save crosses the disk boundary. Rebuilding `/setup` around a staged
value was the alternative and it was rejected: one screen holding both rules
is a screen where a user cannot tell which controls commit, which is the
confusion staging exists to remove. Two pages, with Save as the explicit
boundary between an in-memory proposal and a disk-backed configuration.

`/start` also links every staged controller into the full `/map?target=stage`
authoring path. `/profiles` owns customer-facing create/update/delete/switch:
new profiles inherit matching saved base devices and controller behavior;
updates preserve profile-specific devices by default (or explicitly refresh
keyboard/mouse selectors); the selected layout applies to every resulting
player; delete removes exactly one profile and keeps layouts. Update/delete
use backups and stale-write guards in the backend.

`/check` is the one page that performs no verb at all, and the one fed by a
channel that is not the control pipe: `GET /api/live` is Server-Sent Events
over the daemon's own outbound-only feed pipe, which is what lets a press on
the panel light a control in a browser at display rate. It is still a VIEW —
it writes nothing, and it decides nothing, because its whole control roster is
`MapperSlot::bindings`' key set arriving from the backend (§1).

Eight pages, dozens of routes: the rest are the `/api/*` reads, the mutating
form endpoints, the service worker, the asset handler and three icons. The
distinction is not pedantry — it is the whole reason the CSRF guard is one
layer over the router rather than a check per handler, because "the mapper
alone grew eight form endpoints in three milestones" and the failure mode
being prevented is forgetting one.

For the **whole config root**, `/setup` has exactly two verbs: Export downloads
it as one JSON document, and Import pastes one back (dry run unless the write
box is ticked — `ksx config import`'s consent shape, unchanged). Neither takes
a path: `MachineSource::config_export|config_import` are in-memory on purpose,
because a person who asked a page for their configuration should not be handed
a directory to go and find. These are not the page's only actions: the
checklist also reaches slot assignment and the learner's prove/cancel pair, and
its board step links to `/devices`. A config root appears on that page once, in
small print, for a bug report to quote.

`/map` is good enough to stop treating as supplemental tooling. Authoring a
25-binding preset is a pointer-and-keyboard task and the browser is simply
better at it than immediate-mode GUI. **Studio is promoted to a core surface for
authoring** — co-equal with the egui, not above it.

It is deliberately *not* promoted to primary for operating. If Studio were the
only way to start a session, a cabinet in attract mode would need a web server,
a free port and a browser running before anyone could play. That is a worse
appliance than the one that exists now.

## §6 Product launch and cabinet-to-Studio navigation

Windows customer launch is `ksx-launcher.exe` → sibling `ksx.exe open` → an
idle or configured daemon → Studio `/start`. The launcher is a GUI-subsystem
handoff used by the installer and customer shortcuts, not another surface.
The empty-config daemon owns the control pipe/tray while doing no emulation
work, which is what makes first-run staging reachable.

The cabinet app has an "Open Studio" action. That direction is correct: the
process already running at the machine can open the workbench.

**The reverse was rejected.** A browser cannot launch a native app without a
registered custom protocol (`ksx://`), which means writing registry entries at
install time and a security prompt on every click — real friction and a real
install-time footprint, bought for a convenience the egui already provides in
the direction that works.

## §7 LAN access needs a pairing token, and the guard needs to learn about it

`ksx studio --help` already records the intent:

> Localhost only — there is no LAN option; that arrives with the pairing token.

**A LAN bind is not the same class of problem as a Node dev server on a laptop.**
That comparison is tempting and wrong. A dev server serves files nobody attacks;
Studio can **start and stop input capture, stream per-key activity, create test
pads, rewrite config, and request an installed exact-device WinUSB
prepare/release transaction**. The fixed elevated helper keeps that request
from becoming arbitrary privileged execution, but the capability makes a LAN
token more—not less—necessary. A home network is not a trust boundary: a guest
phone, a smart TV or a compromised IoT device is on the same WiFi.

So LAN access is: bind beyond loopback, require a token, reject anything
unauthenticated. Two consequences worth writing down before the work starts:

- **Discovery is a QR code in the egui.** Nobody types
  `http://192.168.1.47:4460/?t=xK9m…` on a phone. A copyable URL is the laptop
  fallback, not the primary path.
- **`ksx-studio/src/guard.rs` will reject it — twice, and the second one is the
  easy miss.** There are two independent checks and a LAN bind has to clear
  both:

  1. `is_loopback_host` on the `Host` header, the DNS-rebinding defence. A LAN
     address fails it, and the request never reaches a handler (421).
  2. `is_own_origin` on the `Origin` header of every mutating request. A form
     posted from `http://192.168.1.47:4460` fails it too, because the origin
     check ends in *and the host is a loopback name*.

  Fix only the first and you ship a Studio that **renders on the phone and
  refuses every button** — a 403 on every form, which reads as a broken app, not
  as a security feature. Both checks now consult the bound address, so each
  passes for the address ksx is actually serving on; that half is inert while
  the bind stays loopback-only, and it is pinned by two tests in `guard.rs` so
  the LAN change-set cannot land with the trap still in it. What is still
  missing is the token, which is the part that makes the bind *safe* rather than
  merely *working*.

  Writing those tests turned up the same shape of bug already shipped: the two
  checks disagreed about `[::1]`. `Host` accepted it, `Origin` did not — an
  already-split IPv6 name was being re-split on its own colons, so `::1` became
  `::` — and a dual-stack machine that landed on the IPv6 loopback got a Studio
  that rendered and 403'd every form. Exactly the failure this bullet predicts,
  arriving early and by a different route.

## §8 Mobile: responsive-only, aimed at diagnostics

No dedicated touch layout yet, and no deferring mobile either — because there is
one phone use case that beats every other surface:

**You are behind the cabinet with the panel open, pressing buttons, and the
phone in your hand shows which key fired.** That is ButtonCheck on a phone, and
it is better than walking round to the monitor for every wire.

Two corrections to how that reads — the first of which was itself wrong, and
is kept because *how* it was wrong is this repo's most instructive audit
failure to date:

**The viewport tag was never missing.** An earlier revision of this section
said "responsive-only currently means not responsive at all: there is no
`<meta name="viewport">` anywhere in `studio-ui/` or `ksx-studio/assets`", a
task was filed to add the one line, and the line was added — producing a
DUPLICATE, because `forma-server`'s own template (`template.rs`, 0.1.4 and
0.2.0 alike) has emitted the tag on every page this crate ever rendered.
Three separate greps reached the same false conclusion the same way: they
searched the page's *source*, and the head of these pages is assembled by a
dependency, so the truth was only ever in the *output*. The claim is now
pinned where the truth lives — `render.rs::assert_complete_head` reads the
rendered HTML and asserts the tag is present, in `<head>`, exactly once —
and the lesson generalises: **an audit of a claim about output must read the
output.** Breakpoints and media queries therefore already fire on phones;
what they fire *against* is layouts nobody has tuned, which is the actual
work (task #24).

**The missing Studio live channel was real at the audit and is now closed.** At
that point there was no feed on `AppState`, no frame type and no handler, so the
phone argument rested on an egui-only capability. Today `/check` gets its
control roster from the ordinary snapshot and lights it from `GET /api/live`,
an SSE bridge over the daemon's outbound feed pipe (§5). The matrix therefore
calls Studio a `view`, not `planned`: it renders live backend state and performs
no decision or write.

What remains is the responsive pass itself: tune `/check` first for the behind-
the-cabinet phone use case, then `/` and status, with `/map` last. Mapping asks
you to press the key it is capturing, which a phone cannot do for a desk
keyboard, so it is the least valuable page on the smallest screen.

## §9 User flows worth writing down

Five journeys carry nearly all the product's surface area:

1. **First-time setup and later repair** — two related journeys on two pages,
   not an automatic history-based fork. `ksx open` always lands on `/start`;
   someone maintaining a saved configuration deliberately chooses `/setup`.
   `/devices` remains read/pick/remove only. The `/start` journey has the one
   deliberate exception: a separate top-level, three-consent installed WinUSB
   preparation/release card for the exact selected keyboard. Picking the row
   itself still changes only the in-memory stage.

   **Studio's `/start`** is the download-to-gaming path (`docs/FIRST-RUN.md`
   moments 4–7): pick a keyboard from a list nobody had to ask for, pick what it
   should become, map buttons/chords/turbo/macros in the reused mapper, answer
   split-or-freeze, then save or play. It reads the live device/pad state and
   available controller layouts, but it does not seed the proposal from
   `config.toml` and writes no file until Save. The person walking it has not
   decided anything yet and must not be punished for exploring. Play can happen
   without Save. Its whole draft is one `ksx_core::StagedSetup` in the idle
   daemon/control host. The final Guide instruction is conditional on Windows'
   controller-to-Game-Bar setting and links directly to that Settings page.

   **Studio's `/setup`** (§5) is the same territory for someone who already has
   a configuration: the checklist is decided in the backend
   (`ksx-backend::onboard::plan_steps`, pure) and rendered, never re-derived per
   surface. The board step LINKS to the devices screen instead of duplicating
   it; slot assignment is one complete saved-config act; the proof step uses the
   learner and writes nothing. Because there is no multi-step pending wizard
   transaction, an abandoned run leaves the last complete config valid.
2. **Change a mapping** — running cabinet, one binding is wrong.
3. **"It doesn't work"** — the diagnostic path, which must terminate in a cause
   and not a shrug.
4. **Start a session** — the everyday path, and the one that must never need a
   keyboard.
5. **Manage saved games** — create, repair, rename or delete a profile and
   switch to it entirely in Studio. Program paths are edited in the profile
   disclosure; no TOML or CLI is part of the customer flow.

Each should name the surface it happens on. Where a flow crosses surfaces, that
crossing is a design smell worth a second look.

## §10 What this settles for open work

- **Slot persona menu** — **settled and built, 2026-08-08 (task #8).** The
  decision stands as it was written: authoring, so Studio primary, egui view.

  The wire type changed, which is what this entry was waiting for.
  `SlotAssignRequest` now carries `persona` as an **optional string**, and both
  halves of that are load-bearing. *Optional*, because `Persona::default()` is
  `xbox360`: a defaulted field would have read every pre-2026-08-08 request as
  "make this slot an Xbox 360 pad" and silently un-PlayStation-ed slots 5–8 the
  first time somebody re-pointed a preset. *A string*, because ksx-core carries
  no serde and the alias table lives in one `FromStr` — a surface must never
  hold a copy of it to fill this field. The serde test that pinned the old
  field set still pins the new one; it was renamed and re-argued, not deleted.

  What each surface got, and why:

  - **Backend** (`ksx-backend/src/slots.rs`) applies it, and refuses two things in
    words: a persona this build cannot plug (`Persona::can_plug`, which reads
    the backend's `is_implemented` and never a driver probe) and a fifth XInput
    slot — counted **after** the write would land, over the whole destination
    file, so the refusal is about the config that would exist rather than about
    the one field being touched.
  - **CLI** — `ksx slot assign --slot N --persona P`, lenient parsing through
    the same `FromStr`. Preset and persona are independently optional: either,
    both, or the preset alone.
  - **Studio** — the picker sits on `/setup`'s "Wire a slot" form, beside the
    slot and preset selects that already POST `slot-assign`. **Not `/profiles`,
    which has no slot rows**: a second slot editor on a second page would be
    two front doors onto one verb, which is the drift §1 forbids. The option
    list is `SetupView::personas`, served by the backend with a `can_plug` flag
    and a `why_not` sentence per entry; nothing about personas is spelled in
    TypeScript.
  - **egui** — renders the persona in the Presets screen's slot rows. No
    picker: §4's rule is that anything needing text entry or a menu of five
    belongs elsewhere, and re-personaing is a between-sessions authoring act,
    not something done standing at the cabinet mid-evening.
- **Device pick UI** — Studio, following the existing CLI verb (§3). Also the
  egui: §3 row 3 no longer claims a view exists there. `/setup`'s first step
  links to `/devices` rather than growing a second picker.
- **`ksx games new|update|delete` — the CLI half of profile CRUD, owed.**
  Studio's `/profiles` page calls typed `MachineSource` verbs over pure
  plan/apply pairs in `ksx-backend::profile_edit`; the CLI row is now honestly
  `planned` instead of hiding that absence inside configuration verbs. A future
  CLI is a thin driver over these same planners, not new profile logic.
- **Cabinet slot list scrolling** — egui, operating surface, still broken above
  four slots. The body *is* inside a `ScrollArea`; what is missing is any
  scroll-to-focus call, so the joystick can move the cursor to a row that is
  off-screen with no way to bring it into view (`nav.rs` moves the cursor with
  wraparound and no page-up, deliberately).
- **LAN + token + QR** — one coherent change-set, not three (§7), and the guard
  has two checks in it, not one.
- **Viewport meta tag** — one line, and the precondition for anything in §8.
