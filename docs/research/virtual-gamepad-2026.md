# Virtual Xbox 360 / XInput Gamepads on Windows 11 — State of the Art, August 2026

## TL;DR

**Target ViGEmBus 1.22.0 via the `vigem-client` Rust crate today, behind a `VirtualPadBackend` trait.** It is the only stack that (a) is production-signed and installable on stock Windows 11 with Secure Boot on, (b) produces *genuine* XInput slots via Microsoft's own `xusb22.sys`, and (c) has a working pure-Rust client. It is abandoned but not broken. Design for replacement: the two credible successors (**HIDMaestro**, **libvirtualhid**) are both < 1 year old and neither has Rust bindings yet.

## 1. ViGEmBus — status

| Fact | Detail |
|---|---|
| Archived | 2 Nov 2023, repo read-only, banner "🧟 THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN RETIRED 🧟" |
| Reason | Trademark conflict with **ViGEM GmbH** (discovered May 2023); mutual agreement forced retirement of the name "ViGEm" and the `vigem.org` domain |
| Last release | **v1.22.0** (2 Nov 2023) — "It's dead, Jim". Driver binary unchanged from **v1.21.442.0** (30 Aug 2023), which was the last functional release (added ARM64, DS4 output-report SDK APIs) |
| License | **BSD-3-Clause** — legally forkable; only the *name* is encumbered |
| Signing | Production-signed by Nefarius Software Solutions e.U. via the Windows Hardware Dev Center. **Still valid** — cross-signed driver catalogs do not expire the way an EV-signed binary does |
| Works on Win11 24H2/25H2? | **Yes.** No credible reports of the 1.22.0 driver failing to load on 24H2 or 25H2. Reported failures are installer/orchestration issues (e.g. Sunshine #4862, Mar 2026), not driver-load rejections |
| HVCI / Memory Integrity | No published incompatibility. It is a WDF/DMF-based bus driver with no known HVCI violations |

**What Nefarius recommends now:** nothing, publicly. The EOL statement only tells you to repoint the auto-updater to `aiu.api.nefarius.systems` or uninstall. It says a successor "**VirtualPad**" is in the works.

**VirtualPad** is **commercial and closed**: *"Nefarius VirtualPad is a commercial framework for gaming peripherals emulation available to business partners of Nefarius Software Solutions e.U."* There is no public SDK, no pricing, no self-serve access. In March 2026 the PadForge author formally asked Nefarius to license VirtualPad's DualSense emulation to open-source projects (open-source the component / non-commercial license / anything). Nefarius replied on 5 Mar 2026 with *"Thanks & received, please give me some time to reply 🙏"* and **never followed up**. As of Aug 2026 the thread is still unresolved.

**Verdict: VirtualPad is not an option for a hobby Rust project.**

## 2. Community successors / forks

**There is no maintained hard fork of ViGEmBus.** ~400 GitHub forks exist; none has taken over maintenance. The blocker is not code — it's that anyone shipping a rebuilt `ViGEmBus.sys` needs their own Dev Center account + EV cert + attestation submission, and would have to rename it (trademark).

Instead, two **from-scratch** replacements appeared in 2026, both deliberately avoiding kernel-mode:

### 2a. HIDMaestro (hifihedgehog) — the most interesting one

- **MIT licensed**, free and open source, commercial use explicitly welcome
- **Pure user-mode UMDF2** HID minidriver hosted by Windows' inbox `mshidumdf.sys`. No kernel component, no BSOD surface
- **228 device profiles / 32 vendors** with byte-exact VID/PID + HID report descriptors (Xbox 360 Wired, Xbox Series, DualSense, DS4v2, Switch Pro with real subcommand handshake, wheels, HOTAS…)
- **Presents to every API simultaneously**: DirectInput, XInput, SDL3/HIDAPI, browser Gamepad API, WGI/GameInput, RawInput
- **XInput slots**: a *companion device registers the XUSB interface*, so Xbox-family profiles get real XInput slots, capped at Windows' native 4. Non-Xbox profiles are unlimited
- **Signing**: installs via a locally-generated, locally-trusted certificate. **No EV cert, no test-signing boot mode, no reboot** — admin rights only. (Composite audio/haptics personas bundle WHLK-certified `usbip-win2 0.9.7.7`)
- **Latency**: ~35 µs median input; ~0.15 ms output (rumble) callback latency since v1.4.0
- **Force feedback**: HID PID 1.0 writes + rumble raise an `OutputReceived` event; routing to real hardware is the consumer's job
- **Latest**: **v1.4.3** (1 Aug 2026). 506 commits, ~51 stars, 3 forks
- **API**: **C# only** (`HIDMaestro.Core.dll`, `HMContext`/`HMGamepadState`/`HMButton`). **No C, C++, or Rust bindings.** Requires .NET 10 runtime
- **Known open bug**: dual enumeration (xinputhid companion + separate HID interface) causes **double-input on the WGI surface** — D-pad moves two positions in the Start menu / Xbox accessories app. Unfixed as of v1.1.15 line; fixed on the Chromium Gamepad surface only

### 2b. libvirtualhid (LizardByte / Sunshine)

- **Cross-platform C++** virtual HID library; on Windows a **UMDF2 driver over Microsoft's Virtual HID Framework (VHF)**
- Descriptor-driven profiles: Xbox 360 / One / Series, DS4, DualSense, Switch Pro
- API: `lvh::Runtime::create()` → `runtime->create_gamepad(lvh::profiles::dualsense())`; callbacks for rumble, LEDs, adaptive triggers, raw HID output reports
- **Split license**: library **MIT**; the Windows UMDF driver source and driver packages are **LizardByte Source-Available License 1.0 (LB-SAL 1.0)** — *not* OSI open source
- ARM64 blocked on WHQL/Dev Center signing (Azure Trusted Signing insufficient); x64 is the primary target
- ~54 commits on master, active CI. **No tagged stable release, no C API, no bindings**
- **XInput/`dwUserIndex` behaviour is undocumented** — this is the single biggest unknown for your use case

## 3. What currently-maintained projects actually use

| Project | Backend (Aug 2026) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **PadForge** v4.1.0 (hifihedgehog) | **HIDMaestro** — migrated *off* ViGEmBus | Fork of x360ce rewritten on SDL3 + HIDMaestro + HidHide + .NET 10. CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. The only shipping proof that HIDMaestro works in production. https://github.com/hifihedgehog/PadForge · https://padforge.org/ |
| **DS4Windows** | **Still ViGEmBus** | `schmaldeo/DS4Windows` **archived 5 Mar 2026**; `nefarius/DS4Windows-schmaldeo` mirror also carries the discontinuation notice; `hbashton/DS4Windows` continues the lineage. All still ship ViGEmBus + .NET 8. https://github.com/hbashton/DS4Windows |
| **Sunshine** (LizardByte) | **ViGEmBus, now *bundled* in the installer** — was download-on-demand | Since v2025.110.45857 Sunshine *hard-fails* without ViGEmBus. Issue #3527 "Transition away from ViGEmBus" (opened 10 Jan 2025) closed as duplicate. Replacement is **PR #5368 "feat(input): implement libvirtualhid"**, opened 3 Jul 2026, **still draft, 21/61 tasks done**; rumble incomplete for some pad types, Xbox Series Share button missing; ARM64 still falls back to ViGEmBus. https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/issues/3527 · https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/pull/5368 |
| **XOutput** | **ViGEmBus** | Explicitly chose ViGEmBus over DLL-injection precisely because the virtual pad is indistinguishable from real hardware to UWP/Store games and anti-cheat. https://xoutput.org/ |
| **x360ce 4.x** | **ViGEmBus** | Last stable **4.17.15.0, 15 Nov 2020**. Effectively dormant — PadForge is its living descendant. https://github.com/x360ce/x360ce |
| **JoyShockMapper** (Electronicks) | **ViGEmBus, optional** | JSM 3 exposes virtual Xbox/DS4 pads *if* ViGEm Bus is installed. https://github.com/Electronicks/JoyShockMapper |
| **Parsec** | Own gamepad path; **ViGEmBus documented as the "legacy controller emulation method"** | https://support.parsec.app/hc/en-us/articles/32381705301908-Setup-Gamepad |

**Takeaway:** in Aug 2026 the installed base is still overwhelmingly ViGEmBus. Exactly one shipping consumer app (PadForge) has moved off it, and the highest-profile migration (Sunshine) is a draft PR a month old.

## 4. vJoy — not relevant to you

- **DirectInput-only.** Produces a generic HID joystick with a feeder API (`vJoyInterface.dll`). It **cannot** produce an XInput device
- Original repo archived; official final build **v2.2.1.1** has **expired signing certificates**, so Windows 10/11 block `vjoy.sys`
- `njz3/vJoy` fork (improved FFB) could not ship on Win11 for the same signing reason
- Community rescue: forks (e.g. **BrunnerInnovation/vJoy**) sponsored the Microsoft **attestation signing** run and now distribute signed Win11 drivers; `vjoy.pro` is a community manifest/mirror hub
- Still the right tool for >32-button / many-axis DirectInput devices (flight sim, pedals, head tracking). **Wrong tool for Xbox 360 emulation.**

https://github.com/njz3/vJoy · https://github.com/BrunnerInnovation/vJoy · https://vjoy.pro/

---

## 5. Rust ecosystem

### `vigem-client` (CasualX) — the one to use
- https://github.com/CasualX/vigem-client · https://docs.rs/vigem-client · https://crates.io/crates/vigem-client
- **100% pure Rust**, talks `DeviceIoControl` to `\\.\ViGEmBus` directly — **no `ViGEmClient.dll` dependency**. This matters: it means you have no C++ redistributable/native-lib link step
- **v0.1.4, published 1 Aug 2022. Last commit 1 Aug 2022.** ~11k recent downloads. MIT. Unmaintained but *complete* for X360
- API coverage:
  - `Client`, `TargetId`, `Xbox360Wired<C>`, `DualShock4Wired<C>` (DS4 marked WIP)
  - `XGamepad`, `XButtons` for state
  - `plugin()`, `unplug()`, `wait_ready()`, `is_attached()`, `update(&XGamepad)`
  - **`get_user_index()` → the XInput `dwUserIndex`.** This is exactly what you need to map physical keyboard → deterministic XInput slot
  - **Request Notification API for X360 targets** landed in commit `b863eb7` (6 Jun 2022) — i.e. **it IS in 0.1.4**. This is the rumble + LED-player-number feedback channel. docs.rs surfaces it poorly; read `src/x360.rs`
- **Risk:** single maintainer, 4 years dormant, 23 stars. But it's ~2k lines of stable IOCTL plumbing against a driver that will never change again. Vendoring it is entirely reasonable.

### `vigem-rust` (arounre)
- https://github.com/arounre/vigem-rust · https://crates.io/crates/vigem-rust
- Higher-level, thread-safe, **rumble + LED delivered over Rust channels**, DS4 motion/touchpad, RAII cleanup. Dual MIT/Apache-2.0. Updated Nov 2025
- **3 commits, 6 stars, 1 fork.** Not battle-tested. Good API ideas to crib; risky as a dependency

### `vigem` — older/abandoned wrapper over the native `ViGEmClient.dll`. Skip.

### For the successors
- **HIDMaestro: no Rust bindings.** The SDK is a .NET 10 assembly. Your options if you migrate: (a) NativeAOT-compile a thin C-ABI shim from C# and P/Invoke it from Rust, (b) spawn a small C# sidecar process and IPC to it, or (c) **reimplement the client in Rust** — the driver, the shared-memory section layout, and the profile JSON are all MIT and documented in `docs/INTERNALS.md`. (c) is the clean answer and is maybe a few hundred lines
- **libvirtualhid: no Rust bindings, no C API** (C++-only). Would need a `cxx`/`autocxx` bridge or a hand-written `extern "C"` shim. Also note the driver package is **LB-SAL 1.0, not MIT** — read it before you redistribute

---

## 6. XInput slot semantics — the part that decides your architecture

This is where ViGEmBus is genuinely hard to replace:

- ViGEmBus creates a PDO whose hardware ID matches Microsoft's inbox **`xusb22.sys`**. Windows loads the real Microsoft XUSB driver on top. The result is **not an emulation of XInput — it *is* XInput.** `XInputGetState` sees it, DirectInput sees it (XUSB exposes both an XUSB class interface and a HID class interface), the Xbox Game Bar sees it, anti-cheat sees a normal Xbox pad
- **`get_user_index()`** returns the zero-based `dwUserIndex`, which is the same number as the **LED quadrant** on a physical pad. For a 4-player cabinet you can read this back per virtual pad and know that keyboard #3 really is P3
- **LED / player number** comes back through the **notification callback** (`request_notification` / the `Xbox360Notification` payload), together with the rumble motor values. The XUSB stack pushes it down exactly as it would to real hardware
- **Slot count:** ViGEmBus itself will happily create more than 4 X360 targets, but **XInput only ever exposes 4**. Targets beyond the 4th exist in the device tree and in DirectInput but get no `dwUserIndex`. For a 10-keyboard → 4-pad design this is fine and matches KSX's four-pad scope
- **Coexistence with real controllers:** slots are assigned **in arrival order** across real + virtual devices. A real Xbox pad plugged into the cabinet will steal a slot and shift your virtual pads. Two mitigations: (a) plug your virtual pads in at boot before anything else and read back `get_user_index()`, (b) **HidHide** the real devices. ViGEm's own docs cite "working around player slot assignment order issues in XInput" as a primary use case
- **HIDMaestro's approach is different and weaker here.** It publishes a HID gamepad and a *companion device registering the XUSB interface*, so Windows' `xinputhid` synthesizes a 16-button XInput layout over the 12-button HID descriptor. It works, but it's a synthesis layer — and it's the direct cause of the unfixed **WGI double-input bug** (#8), because WGI enumerates both the xinputhid companion and the raw HID interface
- **libvirtualhid** is VHF-based and publishes plain HID gamepads. Whether Xbox profiles land in real XInput slots is **undocumented**. Assume DirectInput/RawInput/SDL work and **verify XInput yourself before committing**

## 7. HidHide — yes, it matters to you

- https://github.com/nefarius/HidHide · https://docs.nefarius.at/projects/HidHide/
- Kernel upper-filter "device firewall": hides selected HID devices from all processes except an allowlist. This is how DS4Windows/PadForge stop games from seeing *both* the physical DS4 and the virtual X360 pad
- **Latest: v1.5.230.0** (May 2026) — so it *is* still getting releases, unlike ViGEmBus
- **But**: the maintainer states there is *"no capacity for any major works on HidHide"*; meaningful development requires community PRs
- **Active Windows 11 25H2 bug**: issue **#215** (30 Jun 2026) — `HidHideClient.exe` (and the CLI) crash on every launch with `ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER` in `GetWhitelist` (`FilterDriverProxy.cpp:91`), reproducible across driver versions **1.2.98.0 → 1.5.230.0**. The *driver* loads and runs fine; it's the config UI/CLI that dies. Unresolved
- **Relevance to your cabinet:** **medium, not critical.** Your inputs are *keyboards*, captured exclusively by the Interception driver — HidHide's classic job (hiding a physical pad that would otherwise double up with the virtual pad) doesn't apply. You *would* want it if a user also plugs a real gamepad in, or if you want to hide the I-PAC keyboards from games that read RawInput/DirectInput keyboard state. Given #215, plan to drive HidHide via its **driver IOCTLs directly from Rust** rather than shelling out to the broken CLI

https://github.com/nefarius/HidHide/issues/215

## 8. Driver signing reality in 2026

**Kernel-mode (what ViGEmBus is):**
- Since Windows 10 1607, Windows will not load any new kernel-mode driver not signed by the **Microsoft Dev Portal**
- Requires: a Windows Hardware Dev Center account **backed by an EV code-signing certificate** (~**$226–250/yr**, hardware token or HSM), then either **attestation signing** (no HLK testing, Win10+ client only) or full **WHQL/HLK**
- **Azure Trusted Signing does *not* support EV certificates and does *not* sign Windows drivers.** It cannot replace the EV cert requirement, and it explicitly cannot produce ARM64 driver packages
- Verdict: **a hobby project cannot realistically ship its own signed kernel bus driver.** The recurring cost, the EV identity-validation process (business entity required in practice), and the Dev Center onboarding are all real barriers

**User-mode (UMDF2 — what HIDMaestro and libvirtualhid are):**
- This is the loophole both projects exploit. UMDF2 driver DLLs run in user mode under `WUDFHost`/`mshidumdf.sys`; the **kernel-mode code signing policy does not apply to them**
- On **x64**, installing a UMDF2 driver package whose catalog is signed by a **self-generated certificate placed in Trusted Root CAs + Trusted Publishers** works, with admin rights, **without disabling Secure Boot and without test-signing boot mode**. Multiple developers confirm this on OSR/MS Q&A, and HIDMaestro ships it as its standard install path
- On **ARM64** this breaks — ARM64 requires a Microsoft dashboard signing path. Both HIDMaestro and libvirtualhid hit this wall
- **Caveat**: you are asking the user to trust a machine-generated root CA. That's an acceptable trade on a dedicated arcade cabinet; it would be a red flag on a shared machine

## Recommendation for your Rust backend

### Primary: **ViGEmBus 1.22.0 + `vigem-client`**

Rationale specific to an arcade cabinet:

1. **Real XInput slots via Microsoft's own XUSB driver.** No synthesis layer, no WGI double-input bug, no "does MAME/RetroArch/Steam see it?" uncertainty. `get_user_index()` gives deterministic P1–P4 mapping, which is central to KSX's virtual-pad contract
2. **It is a dedicated, pinned machine.** The #1 argument against a dead driver — "what if a future Windows breaks it?" — is defused by simply not letting the cabinet chase Windows feature updates. Windows 11 Pro lets you defer/pin
3. **Pure-Rust client, zero native deps.** `vigem-client` speaks IOCTL directly. No `ViGEmClient.dll`, no MSVC redist coupling in your build
4. **You don't need what the successors offer.** HIDMaestro's headline features are byte-exact DualSense/Switch Pro identity, adaptive triggers, controller audio, haptics. An arcade cabinet with joysticks and buttons needs none of it. You need 4 X360 pads with correct slots. ViGEmBus does exactly that and nothing else
5. **Still the ecosystem default.** DS4Windows, XOutput, JoyShockMapper, Sunshine (bundled), Parsec (legacy path) all still ship it. It is not going to stop working quietly

**Implementation notes:**
- **Vendor `vigem-client`** into your repo (MIT, ~2k LOC, dormant upstream). Don't take a crates.io dependency on an unmaintained crate for a load-bearing component
- Use `request_notification` even though the cabinet has no rumble — it's how you receive the **LED player index**, which is your ground truth for slot assignment
- **Bundle the ViGEmBus 1.22.0 installer** with your app (this is exactly what Sunshine now does) rather than downloading it — the download endpoints are the part Nefarius explicitly warned would rot
- Verify the installer's signature is `Nefarius Software Solutions e.U.` before running it

### Architecture: abstract the backend from day one

```
trait VirtualPadBackend {
    fn plug(&mut self, slot_hint: u8) -> Result<PadHandle>;
    fn update(&mut self, h: PadHandle, state: &PadState) -> Result<()>;
    fn user_index(&self, h: PadHandle) -> Option<u8>;   // XInput dwUserIndex
    fn poll_feedback(&mut self, h: PadHandle) -> Option<Feedback>; // rumble + LED
    fn unplug(&mut self, h: PadHandle) -> Result<()>;
}
```

This is ~1 day of work and it is what makes plan B cheap. Keep `PadState` in ViGEm's `XGamepad` shape (it's the XInput wire format anyway) so no backend needs a translation layer.

### Plan B (in order of preference, if ViGEmBus dies)

1. **HIDMaestro** — MIT, actively developed (v1.4.3, 1 Aug 2026), user-mode, no EV cert, proven in production by PadForge, and the *only* successor with a shipping consumer. **Write a native Rust client against its shared-memory protocol** rather than P/Invoking the .NET SDK — everything you need (driver, section layout, profile JSON, `docs/INTERNALS.md`) is MIT. Before committing, **test whether the WGI double-input bug (#8) affects your frontend** (it will hit the Xbox Game Bar / Start menu; it may not matter in MAME/RetroArch/Steam Big Picture)
2. **libvirtualhid** — backed by an organisation (LizardByte) rather than one person, which is a real durability argument. But: no stable release, C++-only API, **driver is source-available not open-source (LB-SAL 1.0)**, and **XInput slot behaviour is unverified**. Revisit when Sunshine PR #5368 merges out of draft
3. **Fork ViGEmBus yourself** — BSD-3-Clause permits it; rename it (drop "ViGEm"). But you'd need an EV cert + Dev Center account (~$250/yr + entity validation) to sign a kernel driver. Only worth it if the project grows well past one cabinet
4. **VirtualPad** — closed, commercial, business-partners-only, and Nefarius has not answered an open-source licensing request in five months. **Do not plan around it.**

### Also worth knowing
- Your existing **Interception** driver (per-keyboard capture) is in a similar boat: still functional on Win11, still receiving user issues (#218 May 2026, #220 Jul 2026), no active development. Common failure is `Could not write to \system32\drivers` under Secure Boot/UAC. Budget for the same "pin the OS, bundle the installer" strategy there
- KSX now serves players 5+ as ViGEm DS4 targets. They are HID/DirectInput
  devices and do not consume XInput's four slots, so games must support
  DirectInput, HID, SDL, or an equivalent input layer for those players. vJoy
  or HIDMaestro are alternative backends, not a requirement for player count;
  see `m6.5-ds4-findings.md` for the measured result and submit-path fix.
