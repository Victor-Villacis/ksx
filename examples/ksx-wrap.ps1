<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Run an emulator (or any program) with ksx emulation up, and ALWAYS stop ksx
    afterwards.

.DESCRIPTION
    This is the LaunchBox / RetroBat integration point. A frontend launches
    this script instead of the emulator; the script starts ksx, runs the
    emulator, and tears ksx down on every exit path.

    The one thing it must never do is leave ksx running with your keyboards
    captured. Every path out is traced below.

.PARAMETER Emulator
    Full path to the emulator executable.

.PARAMETER EmulatorArgs
    Everything after -- is passed to the emulator verbatim (rom paths, flags).

.PARAMETER Game
    games.toml profile whose slot layout ksx should apply. Optional: without it
    ksx uses the [[slot]] entries in config.toml.

.PARAMETER Ksx
    Path to ksx.exe. Defaults to ksx.exe on PATH.

.PARAMETER TimeoutSeconds
    How long to wait for ksx to arm the pads before giving up (default 20).

.EXAMPLE
    .\ksx-wrap.ps1 -Emulator "C:\RetroBat\emulators\mame\mame.exe" `
                   -Game "Four-player Example" -- example-game

.NOTES
    Exit code = the emulator's exit code, except:
      2  ksx refused to start (bad config, missing driver, unknown profile) —
         the emulator was NOT run, because a 4-player cabinet game with no pads
         is worse than a clear error.
      1  this script itself failed.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why this script is shaped the way it is
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `ksx run` blocks the keyboards it is assigned. If this script exits without
# stopping it, the cabinet is left with dead keyboards and a ghost process, and
# the only ways out are an emergency escape or Task Manager. So ksx is stopped
# from a `finally` block, and the `finally` block is reached from every path:
#
#   1. the emulator exits normally .......... try completes -> finally
#   2. the emulator crashes ................. try completes (a non-zero exit is
#                                             not a PowerShell error) -> finally
#   3. the emulator cannot be started ....... throw -> catch -> finally
#   4. ksx never comes up ................... throw -> catch -> finally
#   5. the user closes the console window ... trap/Ctrl+C -> finally
#      (see the note below: a hard console kill cannot run finally at all,
#       which is exactly why ksx also frees keyboards on process death)
#   6. this script has a bug ................ throw -> catch -> finally
#
# Path 5 has a genuine limit: closing a console window with the X button, or a
# `Stop-Process -Force`, terminates PowerShell without running `finally`. That
# is survivable ONLY because ksx is crash-only by design — when the ksx process
# dies, the Interception driver releases its filters with the context handle and
# every keyboard comes back within a second, with no cleanup required. The
# `finally` block is the tidy path, not the safety net; the safety net is that
# killing ksx is always safe.
