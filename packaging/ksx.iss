; ksx — Inno Setup script.
;
; Build (Inno Setup 6.3 or newer; nothing else is required):
;
;     cargo build --release -p ksx-app --features studio,cabinet
;     cargo build --release -p ksx-launcher
;     cargo build --release -p ksx-winusb-helper
;     third_party\libwdi\build.ps1 -OutputDirectory target\release
;     iscc packaging\ksx.iss
;
; The output lands in packaging\out\ksx-<version>-setup.exe.
;
; The feature flags are not optional for a SHIPPED build: the customer launcher
; runs `ksx open`, which exists only with `studio`; the cabinet surface remains
; available inside ksx.exe for installations that operate it programmatically.
; The launcher is a separate GUI-subsystem executable so opening the product
; never flashes ksx.exe's development console.
;
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; What this installer does and does not do
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; DOES: lay ksx.exe down beside its `drivers\` folder — `ksx install-drivers`
; looks for the bundled ViGEmBus setup at `<exe dir>\drivers\`
; (`ksx_platform::installer::locate`), so the layout here is a contract with
; the program, not a convention.
;
; DOES: offer to install the bundled ViGEmBus driver, as a [Tasks] checkbox,
; by running `ksx install-drivers --yes` — see the [Code] section at the
; bottom for why it is that verb and not the .exe, and why a failure there
; cannot fail this install.
;
; This is a reversal, and the reasoning it replaces is worth keeping: "an
; installer that silently installed a kernel driver would throw away both pins
; and the consent". Both objections are answered rather than ignored. The pins
; are kept because the thing that runs is the verb that owns them, not the
; bundled .exe. The consent is kept because it is asked for, in the wizard, in
; plain words, on a box the user can clear. What was NOT survivable was the
; third fact nobody had weighed: `ksx install-drivers` needs an administrator
; token and ksx never self-elevates, so on a machine without ViGEmBus the only
; route to a working pad was a shell command — and docs/FIRST-RUN.md §7 makes
; "without opening a terminal" the acceptance test for the whole product.
; Setup is already elevated. It is the one moment where installing this costs
; the user nothing they have not already agreed to.
;
; DOES NOT: install Interception. Its licence is non-commercial and its
; installer is not ours to redistribute (docs/DRIVERS.md).
;
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; The icons
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Every icon below resolves to the same generated file,
; assets\brand\dist\ksx.ico (tools\icongen — see assets\brand\README.md):
;
;   SetupIconFile         the setup.exe's own icon, in Explorer and in the
;                         UAC prompt the user is about to trust;
;   UninstallDisplayIcon  the Apps & Features row and the uninstaller. It
;                         points at the INSTALLED ksx.exe rather than at a
;                         copy of the .ico, because build.rs stamps the same
;                         icon group into the exe as resource 1 — one file to
;                         keep current instead of two;
;   [Icons]               the customer shortcuts, which target a separately
;                         stamped launcher carrying the same icon group.
;
; The .ico carries eight SIZE-SPECIFIC entries (16/20/24/32 simplified,
; 48/64/128/256 detailed), so the 16 px wizard title bar and the 256 px
; Explorer view each get art drawn for that size rather than a resample of
; one drawing. Every entry is PNG-compressed (see tools/icongen), which
; Inno Setup 6 reads; 6.3 is the floor here for `ArchitecturesAllowed=
; x64compatible`.
;
; NOT COMPILE-VERIFIED on the machine this was written on — Inno Setup is not
; installed there. The first `iscc` run is the check.

[Tasks]
; CHECKED, and it is the only checkbox here whose default decides whether ksx
; can do its job at all. Without ViGEmBus there is no bus for a virtual pad to
; appear on, so a first-run user reaches Play, presses it, and nothing plugs.
;
; A checkbox rather than an unconditional step, because docs/DRIVERS.md is
; explicit that installing a kernel driver silently throws away the consent —
; and it is right. What it must NOT be is a checkbox whose label makes the
; consequence unguessable: "install drivers" tells a first-time user nothing,
; so the label names the driver, says what it is for, and says it is bundled
; rather than downloaded.
;
; A user who clears it gets a ksx that installs, runs, configures and maps and
; cannot plug a pad. That is a legitimate choice (an existing ViGEmBus from
; DS4Windows or Sunshine is already there, or a machine is being staged), and
; it is a choice they have to be able to reverse: see the [Code] section, which

; There are no customer shortcuts for CLI verbs and no command-line Parameters

[Run]
; The hand-off is THE PRODUCT (docs/FIRST-RUN.md §4 bullet 2). This line used
; to run `ksx doctor`: a person who ticked "run this now" — the one moment the
; installer has their consent to show them what they just bought — got a
; console full of driver tables. That is a developer's answer to a question
; they did not ask, and it is the last screen of the install, so it is also
; their first impression of ksx.
;
; The launcher is the same executable both icons run. It starts `ksx.exe open`
; without allocating a console; that verb starts the daemon if needed, waits
; for Studio, then puts a window on screen — moment 3 of FIRST-RUN.md §1.
; `nowait` because that wait is seconds long and the wizard must not hold its
; Finish button hostage for it; `open` exits by design once the window is up.
;
; `runasoriginaluser` matters more than it looks. Setup is elevated
; (PrivilegesRequired=admin, for Program Files and the driver bundle), and
; without this flag the whole chain — `ksx open`, the daemon it starts, and the
; browser window that daemon's Studio ends up in — inherits that token. ksx is
; built to run WITHOUT one: `ksx autostart` registers its logon task as
; InteractiveToken/LeastPrivilege, "never elevated"
; (crates\ksx-backend\src\autostart.rs), so an elevated first daemon would make
; moment 3 behave differently from every boot after it. It would also put the
; Chromium profile ksx owns under the ELEVATING account's %LOCALAPPDATA%, which
; on a machine where a standard user typed an admin's credentials is not the
; profile the user gets tomorrow.

// The bundled ViGEmBus install
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// WHY HERE. `ksx install-drivers` needs an administrator token and ksx never
// self-elevates, so before this existed the only route to a working pad on a
// fresh machine was a shell command typed from an elevated prompt. Setup is
// already elevated and the user has already agreed to that, so this is the
// one moment in the product where the driver can go in for free. It is also
// the last moment before docs/FIRST-RUN.md's seven moments begin, and §7 makes
// "no terminal" the acceptance test for all of them.
//
// WHY THE VERB AND NOT THE .EXE. `drivers\ViGEmBus_1.22.0_x64_x86_arm64.exe`
// is sitting right there and Exec could run it in one line. It must not.
// `ksx install-drivers` is where docs/DRIVERS.md's guarantees live: the bundle
// is located only under a directory a standard user cannot write, opened ONCE
// with writers and deleters denied, SHA-256'd and Authenticode-checked THROUGH
// that handle, and executed at the path that handle itself resolves to. Every
// one of those exists because this is a kernel driver going in with an
// administrator token, and none of them becomes less necessary because it is
// Inno doing the running. One code path owns the checks.
//
// WHY IT IS ALSO THE UPGRADE AND REPAIR PATH. The verb is idempotent by
// construction: with ViGEmBus healthy its plan is `already-installed`, which
// runs nothing and exits 0, so a re-install and an upgrade both cost one
// process start. The one machine it does act on is the broken one - a
// registered service whose ViGEmBus.sys has gone missing - which is exactly
// what `ksx doctor` tells people to fix this way.
//
// WHY IT CANNOT FAIL THE INSTALL. A driver that will not go in leaves a ksx
// that still installs, still runs, still configures and still maps. It just
// cannot plug a pad. Turning that into a failed install would take away the
// nine tenths that work to punish the one tenth that did not, so every path
// below records what happened (in `DriverNote`, declared at the top of this
// section) and returns.
