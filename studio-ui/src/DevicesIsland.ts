// The `/devices` island: which boards are plugged in, which one ksx is
// configured to use, and the two writes that change that.
//
// # What this page is, and the three things it is not
//
// It is the web face of `ksx device scan` (read) plus `ksx device pick`,
// `ksx device remove`, and the narrow orphaned-certificate cleanup. Every
// button here is one `MachineSource` call; nothing below decides what is safe
// to remove.
//
// It is NOT a claim screen. Exact-device preparation and release live in the
// guarded Setup flow. The certificate cleanup here names no device, subject,
// thumbprint, store or path: it can only ask the installed fixed-purpose
// helper to remove certificates the backend proved no live package uses.
//
// It is NOT the other two removals. ksx has three and they are routinely
// confused: `ksx pads --prune` drops stale VIRTUAL PADS off the ViGEm bus,
// `ksx winusb release` puts a claimed board BACK on the keyboard driver, and
// the Remove button here deletes a `[[device]]` entry from config.toml.
// Deleting the entry releases nothing. The card at the foot of the page says
// so, and the remove outcome says so again when the board really is claimed.
//
// # Compiler constraints (identical to StatusIsland.ts — read them there)
//
// - dynamic text/attrs are bare `() => signalName()` calls; the slot is named
//   after the getter;
// - list sources are bare `() => listSignal()` calls;
// - list item bodies may only use direct member reads (`r.alias`);
// - createShow conditions are bare `() => signalName()` calls;
// - no string concatenation anywhere in the tree. A `+` compiles to an
//   ANONYMOUS slot the server can never inject (render.rs ledger #10/#20), so
//   every composed sentence is composed in `applyDevices` below and in
//   `render_devices.rs`, and shipped as a signal value. `ANONYMOUS_SLOTS` on
//   the Rust side is asserted EMPTY for this page.
// - optional lines are never conditionally built. A row carries its own class
//   (`r.portWarnCls` = `"dv-warn"` or `"dv-warn dv-hide"`), because a
//   `createShow` inside a `createList` is not a shape this compiler emits.
