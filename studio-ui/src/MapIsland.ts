// THE MAPPER (v5): click a control on the pad art, press the panel key,
// binding saved. One island, same architecture as StatusIsland.ts — the
// module-level signals are the page's live state store AND the compile-time
// slot table (compiler 0.3.1 walks island component files for signal scopes,
// so the twin declarations MapPage.ts used to carry are gone — ledger #9,
// adopted 2026-08-06). `applyMap` seeds them from the server's payload block
// BEFORE adoption (ledger #5) and the 2 s /api/map poller (map.ts) keeps
// rewriting them. Derivations here MIRROR
// crates/ksx-studio/src/render_map.rs (server derives for the SSR first
// paint, this file re-derives per poll); the Rust unit tests pin that side —
// keep both in sync when either changes.
//
// Layout per PadForge's lesson (docs/research/padforge-ui-lessons.md):
// chrome minimal, CONTROLLER HUGE. The art (Gamepad-Asset-Pack, MIT, by
// AL2009man — vendored + recolored by build.mjs, see ../art/README.md) fills
// the bottom of a fixed-aspect stage; the top band holds the LB/RB/LT/RT
// chips, stacked trigger-over-bumper and anchored to the body silhouette.
// Every mappable control is a positioned hit-zone <button data-fn=…> from
// the ZONES tables below (authored from ../art/extents.mjs output — the
// PadForge rule: derive layout from art with a script).
//
// Each zone wears its own identity. The vendored art draws no letters, so
// the zone renders the control's name itself in the canonical colours (A
// green / B red / X blue / Y amber; ✕ ○ △ □ in the Sony hues), with the bound
// key as the small mono tag underneath. Unbound controls still show their
// identity — the pad reads like a controller with nothing mapped at all.
// The bindings LEGEND below the stage is the second reader: the same identity
// glyph, the group prefix, the key, and FEATURE 3's "also A · B" shared-key
// badge; a row click IS the zone click (same data-fn delegation). A shared
// hover signal (`setHot`) cross-highlights zone ↔ legend row, and the
// selection Set does the same for multi-select. Interaction lives in map.ts
// (event delegation, so list reconcile keeps everything wired).

// docs/INPUT-TRANSFORMS.md §6.2 (TAStudio, adopted): rows = steps, columns =
// the slot's controls, cells = held or not. A timed sequence is a SHAPE, and
// an "add step" form hides it.
//
// v12 wires the write path that landed after this card shipped: the daemon's
// `map-macro` verb (= `ksx macro`, = `ControlSource::save_macro`, =
// `POST /api/macro/save`) takes ONE WHOLE `[macros.<name>]` table. So the grid
// is no longer a copy-and-paste composer — New, Save, Rename and Delete are
// real writes to the preset file, through the same verb the CLI uses. The TOML
// block stays, collapsed, as the sharing/hand-editing path it always was.
//
// THE SAVE MODEL — explicit Save, not save-on-edit. The rest of this page is
// save-immediately (a bind is one atomic key write), but a macro save is a
// WHOLE-TABLE write that (a) takes a timestamped backup every time and (b) is
// hot-swapped into the running session. Autosaving every painted cell would
// therefore publish a half-authored sequence into a live game and leave one
// backup file per click. A grid edit is also a COMPOSITION — paint, reorder,
// retime — and the unit the user means is the finished sequence. Hence: the
// body (cells, steps, durations, policies) is a draft with a loud dirty
// indicator and one Save button; the STRUCTURAL verbs (New / Rename / Delete)
// are single explicit actions and write straight away. Both report through the
// toast stack with Undo, exactly like every other write on this page.
//
// Every derivation here mirrors render_map.rs; the Rust unit tests pin that
// side, including the sampling floor against ksx-core's own MIN_STEP_MS.
